<p class="noindent"><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><i>January 1, 1752</i>, an interchange of letters and compliments
from the Wests and Mrs. Montagu take place.
Mrs. West sends a huge turkey and ham pie, half for
Mrs. Montagu, half for Temple West, Gilbert’s brother.
Mr. Pitt, Lady Cobham, and Berenger were expected.
In a letter to her sister, Sarah Scott, Mrs. Montagu
mentions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My Father is going to purchase a fine living for
Willy, indeed he will not enjoy it till after the death of
the present incumbent, but it brings in £470 a year, a
fine reversion for a younger brother, and what, joined
to another moderate living, will be a comfortable subsistence.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the living of Burghfield in Berkshire,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>purchased from the Shrewsbury family, for two lives, of
which in after years William Robinson became rector,
his son Matthew succeeding him. Further in this letter
it says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I recommend to your perusal ‘<cite>The Adventures of
Peregrine Pickle</cite>.’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Lady Vane’s<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> story is well told. Mr.
W. Robinson and the Doctor called on me this morning.
The Doctor talks of Bath for his health, but he is the
best-looking invalid I ever saw. An Irish Bishopric
will cure him entirely. Mrs. Delany is not in England.
Poor Mrs. Donnellan has lost her brother, Dr. Donnellan,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>

was chaplain to the Duke of Dorset, then Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland, and had just been made Bishop of
Killala. They were immense men, with fine features
and rosy cheeks. Mr. Richard Cumberland<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> calls Dr.
Richard Robinson “a colossal man.” So attached was
Sir William to his brother Richard that Cumberland
says he imitated the Archbishop in everything, even to
the size of his shoes, diet, and physic!</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sherlock desires to join me in respects to you

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p>In March, Mr. Pitt obtained for Mr. Gilbert West the
clerkship of the Privy Council, a lucrative office.</p>

<p>On March 25, from Hayes to Wickham, Mrs. Montagu
writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I thank you most heartily for immediately
giving me the sincerest joy I have felt for this long
time. May you long enjoy what you have so late
attained.... You cannot imagine the pleasure I propose
in hearing your friends congratulate you on
Fortune’s first courtesy. Base Jade! to be so tedious
and so sparing in her favours.”</p>
</div>

<p>With many congratulations to Mrs. West, etc., to
which Lydia Botham, then at Hayes, added a few lines,
Mrs. Montagu announces she will convey him and Mrs.
West to London the next morning in her post-chaise,
and they shall stay in Hill Street, where Mr. Montagu
was attending to his parliamentary business; and, she
adds, to fix an hour “so as to be with the President of
the Council at 12 o’clock.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. WILLIAM CHESILDEN</div>

<p>From London, on April 17, Mr. Montagu writes an
account of the celebrated surgeon, Dr. William Chesilden’s
death—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The papers, I suppose, have informed you of the
death of poor Chesilden. I had an account of the
manner of his death from one Mr. Vourse, an eminent
man in his own profession. He told me the poor man
was with Jerry Pierce and others, telling them how
soon after his being seized with the Palsy he had been
making a bargain with an undertaker to bury him, with
this he was entertaining them with his usual humour,
and in the midst of his story was seiz’d with an apoplectic
fit which finish’d him in half an hour.... I forgot to
add that Mr. Chesilden had eat a great deal of Bread
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>and drank a good quantity of ale; being asthmatic, this
was reckoned to be the cause of his death.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCOTT SEPARATION</div>

<p>It will be remembered that Mrs. Montagu was
always opposed to her sister Sarah’s marriage to
George Lewis Scott. Unfortunately, her fears as to
their felicity were prophetic, for in April, 1752, after
only a year’s matrimony, they separated; incompatibility
of temper was alleged, but from the letters there was
evidently much more below the surface. Mrs. Delany,
writing in April to her sister, Mrs. D’Ewes, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What a foolish match Mrs. Scott has made for herself.
Mrs. Montagu wrote Mrs. Donnellan word that
she and the rest of her friends had rescued her out of
the hands of a very bad man: but for reasons of interest,
they should conceal his misbehaviour as much as possible,
but entreated Mrs. Donnellan would vindicate her
sister’s character whenever she heard it attacked, for
she was very innocent.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sarah was only twenty-nine. Her father and brothers
separated her from Mr. Scott, as is shown in his own
letters to Mr. Montagu, who had been his original
friend. He acknowledged “that Mrs. Montagu knew
nothing of the separation till it was communicated to
her;” in truth she was at Hayes at the time. Her letters
indicate the enmity and rancour of a great lady whose
name was kept behind the scenes. Mr. Scott wrote two
letters to Mr. Montagu, dated April 29 and May 1, but
both are so involved and mysterious as to shed no real
light on his misdemeanours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Montagu received Mrs. Scott at
Hayes, and in a letter to her husband, whom she was
preparing to join in London, says Morris was urging
Mrs. Scott to go to Albury. She says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I could leave her at Hayes when I go to town, but
her spirits are so bad and she is so ill she cannot be
alone.... Indeed, poor creature, her situation is miserable,
allied to the faults and the infamy of a bad man,
subject to his aspersions, and liable to the censures of
his friends (for the worst have some), as in all disagreements
in wedlock, blame falls ever on the innocent
where there is no harmony. ‘How happy to behold in
wedded pair!’ each has the credit of the other’s virtues;
they have double honour, united interests and all that
can make people strong in society. This, my Dearest,
is my happier lot, inriched by your fortune, ennobled by
your virtues, graced by your character, and supported
by your interest.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu accompanied Mrs. Scott to Albury.
She writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We had a very pleasant journey here, and our
horses performed well. We found Lydia and Johnny in
health and happiness, surrounded by five of the finest
children I ever saw; the youngest boy is a little cherubim
and has the finest white hair imaginable.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan, in May, writes from Delville, where
she still was, to Mrs. Montagu, to say that Lord Holderness
was to give up her house in Hanover Square about
August, and as it was too large for her fortune, and
the lease was near its end,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> she wishes Mrs. Montagu to
look out for a house for her “not farther than Windsor
from London. Soon after our return, the Dean and
Mrs. Delany go to Down, and I fear his affairs will not
permit him to go to England this year.” She adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have writ to Mrs. Shuttleworth to bespeak me
a chair of Vaughan.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I would have it plain and light,
lined with white cloath and green curtains, as white and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
green is my livery. If you should go to town, I should
be obliged to you if you would send to Vaughan about
it....</p>

<p>“I now come to the interesting part of your letter,
the unhappy affair of poor Mrs. Scott. I had heard
before I received yours that she and Mr. Scott were
parted, but could hardly believe it, a match so much of
mutual inclination seemed to promise mutual happiness,
and the shortness of the time of their union hardly
allowed them to find out they were not happy, so that
you are unwilling to hurt the gentleman in his character.
I must conclude he is very bad, since in so short a time he
could force Mrs. Scott and all her family to come to such an
<i>éclat</i>. I am extremely concerned for all the uneasiness
you have had on the occasion, but you have had the
consolation of showing yourself a most generous and
kind sister in supporting her in her misfortunes, and
especially as it was a match made against your better
judgment. I beg my compliments to Mrs. Scott, and
I heartily wish her health and spirits to support her
situation; ’tis said here she is returning to Bath to live
with Lady Montagu. On these occasions people love to
seem to know more than perhaps they do; all I say is
that you entirely justify Mrs. Scott, and I am sure you
must know the truth. I hear, too, he has given her back
half her fortune, and has settled a 150 pounds a year on
her; this, I think, is a justification to her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu had indeed a great deal of trouble at
this time, for besides sheltering and endeavouring to
cheer Mrs. Scott’s failing spirits, she had, to say nothing
of her own constant ill-health, the additional trouble of
her favourite brother Jack’s illness, now continuing
some months, of a nervous disorder, which he never
recovered from.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOUTH LODGE — THE REV. WILLIAM ROBINSON</div>

<p>On May 26, from Sandleford, Mrs. Montagu writes to
Mr. West, who is at her house in Hill Street, attending
as clerk to the Privy Council—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I was informed by Mrs. Isted<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that you intended
to return to town in the middle of this week, so
I imagine that by this time you are in the Empire of
China.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The leafless trees and barren soil of my landscape
will very ill bear comparison with the shady oaks
and beautiful verdure of South Lodge, and the grinning
Mandarins still worse supply the place of a British
Statesman: but as you can improve every society and
place into which you enter, I expect such hints from you
as will set off the figures, and enliven the landscape with
rural beauty. I grieved at the rain from an apprehension
that it might interfere with your pleasure at South
Lodge. I hope it did not, but that you saw the place
with the leisure and attention it deserves; if you give
me an account of the parts of it which charmed you
most, or of the whole, you will lead my imagination to
a very fine place in very good company, and I shall
walk over it with great pleasure. I imagine you would
feel some poetic enthusiasm in the Temple of Pan, and
hope it produced a hymn or ode in which we shall see
him knit with the Graces and the Hours to dance, lead
on to the Eternal Spring, through groves of your unfading
bays.”</p>
</div>

<p>South Lodge, Enfield, was then the residence of Mr.
Pitt, the grounds of which he laid out with great taste,
and designed the Temple of Pan. Mrs. Montagu had
recently been on a visit to him here, as will be seen in
West’s answer. At the end of a long letter, which contains
directions as to the ornaments of her room, comments
on her bad health, in which she quotes Pope’s
saying, “ill-health is an early old age,” she winds up
with regretting that Sir George Lyttelton and Miss
West were going to Tunbridge so soon, for “I fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
they will leave the place the earlier, as they go at the
beginning of the season.” She finishes by commending
her brother William, who was to spend a day or two in
Hill Street, to West, saying—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wrote my advice to him to take this opportunity
to pay his respects to you, but possibly a little College
awkwardness, added to natural timidity, may prevent his
doing it. I assure you he is a very good young man,
more I will not say, for having for some years had a
mother’s care of him, I have also a mother’s partiality:
perhaps you may like him the better for his resemblance
to your son.”</p>

<p>To this letter Gilbert West answers on May 30—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Pitt, as you will easily imagine from your own
experience, received and entertained us with great politeness,
and something still more pleasing and solid, with
every mark of friendship and esteem. He had provided
for me a wheeling chair, by the help of which I was
enabled to visit every sequestered nook, dingle and
bosky bower from side to side in that little paradise
opened in the wild, and by the help of my imagination
doubled the pleasure I received from the various Beauties
of Art and Nature, by recalling and participating the
past pleasure of a certain person,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> some of whose remarks
and sayings Mr. Pitt repeated with a secret pride,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>and I heard with equal admiration and delight. The
weather indeed was not so favourable to us as we could
have wished.... Molly<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> indeed, who has an insatiable
ardour in viewing a fine place, and an almost implicit
faith in Mr. Pitt’s taste and judgment, stole out often by
herself, and in defiance of wind or rain walked many
times over the enchanting round.... Kitty<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> has seemed
to be inspired with an unusual flow of spirits, which not
only emboldened her to undertake, but enabled her also
to complete the tour, which I was forced to make in my

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am very glad you and Mrs. West went over
every part of South Lodge, as you see with more
judgment you must see with more pleasure than I did,
and I think there can hardly be a finer entertainment
not only to the eyes but to the mind, than so sweet and
peaceful a scene. I was surprised to hear Mr. Pitt say

<div class="sidenote">CAPTAIN ROBERT ROBINSON — “CHINESE POMP”</div>

<p>Captain Robinson returned from his Chinese expedition
in the <i>Saint George</i> the middle of June, and Mrs.
Montagu and Mrs. Scott met him from Sandleford at
her villa at Hayes. “He has brought me two beautiful
gowns and a fine Chinese lanthorn. We are to go on
board the <i>St. George</i> to-morrow,” she writes to her husband.
He also brought a gown apiece for Lady Sandwich
and her sister, Miss Fane. The greater part of
the Robinson family went to dine on the <i>Saint George</i>,
but on a stormy day, and Mrs. Montagu was very terrified
at the tossing of the small boat they went in. Soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
after this, in the beginning of July, Mrs. Montagu left
for her annual visit to Tunbridge Wells, where she had
taken the “White Stone House” on Mount Ephraim.
Sarah Scott returned to Sandleford to Mr. Montagu,
<i>en route</i> for Bath, where she was about to take up
residence with her friend, Lady Bab Montagu. At
Tunbridge were Sir George and Lady Lyttelton, Mr.
West, Miss Charlotte Fane, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Bower,
the Dean of Exeter, General Pulteney,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> etc. At a big
ball Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shone forth in full Chinese pomp at the ball, my

<div class="sidenote">“A COLD LOAF”</div>

<p>Mr. West from Tunbridge visited his cousins, the
Bothams, at Albury, and found Lydia in a terrible state
of health, and worried with the preparation of her five
children to be inoculated. He persuaded her to go to
Tunbridge to consult Dr. Shaw, and writes from Stoke
to Mrs. Montagu to suggest that Mrs. Botham should
stay with her at Sandleford whilst the children are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>inoculated, and left in their father’s care. He mentions
Mr. Hooke being in a cottage near Stoke, very busy
writing. Lydia Botham, despite of all entreaties, returned
to Albury to remain with her children. Mrs. Montagu
contemplated a visit to Horton, <i>alias</i> Mount Morris, with
her husband, to stay with her brother Matthew, but
violent rheumatism attacked her in the shoulders. She
was reluctantly obliged to let Mr. Montagu visit “the
brethren,” as they termed them, alone. Meanwhile,
West, not being satisfied with the tutor with whom his
son was residing, hastened to Hill Street to remove him
to Oxford. Mrs. Medows<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> writes from Chute on
October 3 to say she had taken her nieces, the Miss
Pulses, to see Sandleford, where they ate “a cold loaf,”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and “I was not a little exalted as a planter when I saw
chestnuts I had set nuts, five and forty feet high.” She
mentions that Mrs. Isted gave them a great many good
things, “and showed several pretty pieces of her painting,
and one of your curtains finished and a handkerchief
the little girl you are so good as to take care of is
making for you, that will look very like point.”</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu set out on October 2 to Horton,
and arrived at Canterbury, where he ascended the
Cathedral tower for the view, his first sight of that
place. His first letter crossed one of his wife’s, in
which she laments her inability to accompany him, and
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I suppose you will see the place with great veneration,
where your consort’s virtues, charms and accomplishments
were ripened to their present perfection,
besides the pleasure of seeing my brothers, which would
have been great. I should have reviewed the place
where I spent the careless days of infancy and the
more gay ones of early youth with satisfaction. To the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Fair, the years from 15 to 20 are very agreeable.” She
continues, “When do my brethren come to town? I
hear my brother Robinson stays to cultivate the
maternal acres. As to the Paternal they will not come
yet. I think he will think of the Père Eternel when
he does not say the Lord’s Prayer. I design to go to
Mrs. Donnellan to-morrow, she is at North End, where
she designs to remain till her house is ready for her

<div class="sidenote">A BACHELOR!</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu having complained of his horse not
liking stony roads, his wife writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am sorry your horse does not like hard roads,
for the ways about Horton are very stony; a dull horse
is like a dull friend, one is safe but not much delighted
in their company.” She adds, “I hope the sight of so
many merry bachelors does not revive in you the love
of a single state. Theirs is the joy of the wicked, not
the pure comforts of a holy state like matrimony....
Poor Mr. Brockman is the only man truly sensible of
the evils of celibacy, and he weeps and will not be comforted,
as all unmarried men should do, were they truly
sensible of their misfortune.”</p>

be my sentiments but that of all the rest of the company.
I have never before now had an opportunity of sufficiently
observing this house, which is very large and
perfectly regular, though it is not placed just where
one could wish it, ’tis easy to see is capable of great
improvement by openings and cuttings in a good deal
of that fine prospect which is now shut out by the walls
and trees; and by grubbing up the bushes and hedges
and making a kind of Paddock on the South side of the
house. A bason of water like that at Newbold might
also be easily made.... Some of these things the
worthy owner is not without having some thoughts of
doing, as well as cutting some walks and vistas through
his wood.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is a picture of Mount Morris in <cite>Harris’
‘History of Kent,’</cite> 1719, a large square house with a
cupola surmounted by a big ball and weathercock. In
front of the house and round it are the small walled
gardens, formally planted, the fashion of the period.
These were eventually pulled down by Matthew Robinson,
the hedges grubbed and all thrown into one large
park,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in which his numerous horses and cattle roamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
at large. Mr. Montagu seemed to have enjoyed some
fine partridge shooting whilst at Horton. He also frequented
“‘Old Father Ocean’ at Hythe, with whose
solemn majestic look I am always delighted.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARCHIBALD BOWER</div>

<p>Visits to the Scotts of Scotts Hall, the Brockmans of
Beachborough, etc., are spoken of. In a letter of the
same date, October 12, to her husband, Mrs. Montagu
first mentions Archibald Bower<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and his wife.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> Archibald Bower, born 1686, died 1766; wrote “<cite>The History of
the Popes</cite>,” etc., etc.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>To give the whole biography of Archibald Bower
would take too much space in this book. An account of
him can be found in the “<cite>National Biography,” <abbr title="volume 6">vol. vi</abbr>.
p. 48</cite>. He was a Scotsman, was sent to Douai, and
entered the Jesuit Society in 1706. In 1717 he studied
Divinity at Rome; became Reader of Philosophy and
Adviser to the College of Arezzo. Horrified at the
“hellish proceedings” of the Court of Inquisition, where
he witnessed the torture of two innocent gentlemen, he
fled to England, and while there made the acquaintance
of Dean Berkeley, the old admirer and friend of Mrs.
Donnellan, who was afterwards Bishop of Cloyne. He
entered, as tutor, the family of Mr. Thompson, Coley
Park, Berks, and afterwards that of Lord Aylmer. He
revised the “<cite>Universal History</cite>.” In 1748 he was made
keeper of the Queen’s Library, and in 1749 he married
a widow with one child, a niece of Bishop Nicholson.
His first volume of his “<cite>History of the Popes</cite>” was
published in 1748, the second in 1751, the third in 1753.
Though renouncing the Jesuit order, he seems to have
had business dealings with the Society, some of which
brought him into considerable obloquy, but they are
too lengthy to be detailed here.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu, returning to Hayes, says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Bower and his wife are to come to me on
Friday, and stay till Saturday or Monday, he is a very
merry entertaining companion. He left all gloominess
in that seat of horrors—the Inquisition. I breakfasted
with him on Tuesday, he is but between two or three
miles from Hayes. His wife is civil and silent, so I asked
her to come over with him. I never saw any country
more beautiful than about Chislehurst, where he lives.
I cannot say much in praise of his habitation, which he
terms his Paradise, but indeed to a mind so gay and
cheerful as his, all places are a Paradise. He is much
engaged with those old ladies, the Popes, but says he
will leave the Santi Padri for his Madonna. He will
teach me the pronunciation of Italian, which he has
reduced to a Method, so it may easily be acquired. He
taught it to Mr. Garrick at Tunbridge.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">“MADONNA”</div>

<p>Apparently Bower was introduced to Mrs. Montagu
by Gilbert West. He was an intimate friend of Sir
George Lyttelton. Both he and Sir George gave Mrs.
Montagu the sobriquet of “Madonna,” but as Bower’s
first letter of 1753 addresses her as “Madonna,” with
him probably the nickname originated. They corresponded
for some years in Italian.</p>

<p>In the next letter of October 14, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Bowers came here yesterday. Mr. and Mrs.
West met them here at dinner, and to-morrow we are
all to dine at Wickham. This morning I shall carry
Mrs. Bower to see Cæsar’s Camp, the prospect from
which is now in high beauty.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">INOCULATION</div>

<p>The five Botham children had been inoculated!
Their mother had been persuaded in her bad health to
leave them in their father’s care. Lydia, writing to
Mrs. Montagu to thank her for a present of Madeira,
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will desire to hear something of my Babes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>My letter from their good Father to-day says they were
well when he wrote, but that my kind and humane
friends, Dr. Shaw and Winchester, who had both been
with them in the morning, said their eyes were so heavy
and their pulses so loaded that they would not hold up
long.”</p>
</div>

<p>A postscript to this letter gives the next day’s
account in Mr. Botham’s words—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dear Babes are all drooping round me, and
wonder not if I tell you I am glad they are so, since
from the gentlest symptoms of the distemper I have a
good foundation to hope they will do well. They are
sometimes up and sometimes down, and sicken so
gradually that Winchester doubts not that they will
have a favourable sort of the smallpox. I expect they
will be in their beds to-morrow.”</p>
</div>

<p>By November 16 the five children were well, and
Mrs. Montagu writes to Mr. West from Sandleford—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mrs. Botham returns to her little family to-morrow,
they are all quite recovered, and I hope this lucky event
will hasten the recovery of my Lydia. I should indeed
be glad to behold the happy smile that will illuminate
her countenance at her return to her babes. Mr.

copy of it as a proper warning to your Mrs. West, and
if you will still proceed in spite of my sad and woeful
example, I cannot help it. I shall repent my misdeeds

<p>Mr. West took Mrs. Montagu’s advice as to going
to Court and “kissing hands, a ceremony which upon

<div class="sidenote">NEW BOOKS</div>

<p>In a letter to Miss Anstey from Mrs. Montagu, of
November 23, we gain a glimpse of the books being read
then—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Hooke has published a second edition of his
‘<cite>Roman History</cite>,’ which is much admired. Mr.

Shaftesbury</cite>’<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> are well spoken of; Lord Orrery<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> has
just published his <cite>Observations on the ‘Life and
Writings of Dr. Swift</cite>.’ ... The ‘<cite lang="la">Biographia Brittanica</cite>’
will entertain you with the Lives of many great
men, some of them are very well written. Mr. Warburton’s<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
<cite>Edition of Mr. Pope’s Works</cite> contains some
new pieces, and some alterations of old ones. ‘<cite lang="fr">The
Memoires du Duc de Sully</cite>’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> are very entertaining....
The Duke of Cumberland has been dangerously ill,
is now something better. Lord Coventry<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> they say
is to marry Miss Gunning. Some actors have appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>at the Theatre, and their characters are not of the first
rank. One of them imitates Mr. Garrick.” This must
have been Foote.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“HISTORY OF THE POPES”</div>

<p>Gilbert West was busied at this time planting his
garden at Wickham with firs and laurels, and Mrs.
Montagu teased him by letter about his “evergreen-nevergreen
garden,” as she called it. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Remember that while you avoid winter, you exclude
Spring, and forbid the glad return of the vernal season,
as well as the sad approach of autumn. In your garden
and in your life, may all that is necessary for shade, for
shelter and for comfort be permanent and unchanged.
May the pleasures and aromatics be various, successive,
sweet and new! ... I shall be much obliged to you if
when you see the incomparable Mr. Bower you will get
of him the second volume of the ‘<cite>History of the Popes</cite>.’
I have almost finished Mr. Hooke’s history. I do not
care to quit the city of Rome till I have seen the establishment
of its spiritual Monarchy.... I have just
received a collection of letters, wrote by Madame de
Maintenon, though Voltaire has diminished my opinion
of her in some degree; yet I have an impatience to open
the book.... I shall like to see what alteration there is
in her from the wife and widow of poor Scarron to
becoming the consort of Louis le Grand.”</p>
</div>

<p>On December 2 Lady Courtenay sent feathers and
shells to Mrs. Montagu for her work. She was the
daughter of Heneage, 2nd Lord Aylesford, and married
to Sir William Courtenay, afterwards 1st Viscount
Courtenay. She was a sister of Lady Andover’s, and a
great friend of Lydia Botham’s, and in this letter expresses
great concern at Lydia’s sad state of health.</p>

<p>On December 29 Mrs. Montagu writes to her sister
Sarah that she had sustained the great loss of her lady
housekeeper, Mrs. Isted, who had died very suddenly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>whilst Mr. and Mrs. Montagu had been spending a few
days with Lydia Botham. The latter was then supposed
to be dying.</p>

<p>From the letters it appears Mrs. Isted was a widow
lady, who had lost an only child, and had been known to
Mrs. Montagu in her more prosperous years. Lydia
Botham rallied for a time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GEORGE LEWIS SCOTT</div>

<p>A great dispute was going on at Leicester House
at this time on the subject of Prince George’s tutors.
Amongst the sub-preceptors, it will be remembered,
was Mr. George Lewis Scott, Sarah’s (<i>née</i> Robinson)
husband. Soon after this he was dismissed from the
list of tutors. One reason alleged was that he was a
Jacobite, but there was little ground for this supposition.
Though a clever man, he seems to have been
quite an unsuitable person to be tutor to the princes,
and Mrs. Montagu comforts Sarah by saying his true
character will now appear. “You will see shortly that
he and you will have justice done you, and with this
difference, that to you it will be a guardian angel, to
him an avenging minister. In the mean time ‘leave him
to Heaven, and the thorns that prick his bosom,’ as says
good Mr. Hamlet.”</p>

<p>On December 23 she had an assembly, and writes
to Mrs. Boscawen that “the Chinese Room was filled
by a succession of people from eleven in the morning
till eleven at night.”</p>

<p>The year ends with a letter to Gilbert West, who
had had a terrible attack of gout, sending him Birch’s<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
“<cite>Life of Archbishop Tillotson</cite>,”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> “which Mr. Birch left
for you himself.”</p>

<div class="year">1753</div>

<p>1753 opens with a letter from Mrs. Donnellan on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>January 2, to Mrs. Montagu, then at Sandleford. In this
she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Two letters from Ireland informed me of a sort of
determination both of Dr. Delany’s affair and my own.
I had a very particular account of both from my Six
Clerk and Manager, Mr. Croker, who is Six Clerk to
Delany’s adversarys, and a short letter from Mrs. Delany.
My Lord Chancellor has acquitted Dr. Delany of a hard
word in the law, called spoliation, but has ordered an
account before two masters in Chancery to be taken of
all the late Mrs. Delany’s personal estate, and what she
was worth when she married the Dean.”</p>
</div>

<p>This law-suit, which lasted some years, and was a
great annoyance and expense to the Delanys, was caused
by his having inadvertently burnt a paper of importance
belonging to his first wife. Mrs. Donnellan’s brother
had claimed the lease of the house lately belonging to
their mother, in London, owing to a defect in the execution
of the will. Mrs. Donnellan got the books, and
some few hundred pounds, but, as she had been residuary
legatee in the will, suffered severe loss which she bore
with exemplary patience.</p>

<p>It is probable that at this period her brother-in-law,
Bishop Clayton, being wealthy and generous, gave up
his wife’s marriage portion to her sister, Anne Donnellan.</p>

<p>Anne now took a house in Bolton Row, London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TURKEY PYE</div>

<p>On January 3 Mrs. Montagu writes to thank Mrs.
West for a portion of Turkey “pye,” and some verses
of her composing with it. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“January 3.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“For your pye and your verses what strains
are sublime enough to return proper thanks! You have
held the balance of justice so exactly and directed its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>sword so well where to fall that Mrs. Temple West and
I are determined to divide the pye this evening according
to the rules prescribed. Though our pye has not
yet been toasted, your verses have been well relish’d
by some of the greatest connoisseurs. About an hour
after I had your letter Miss West came to call on me; I
communicated your poetic strains and we were very
merry over them. When Lord Temple and Sir George
Lyttelton came in we let them have a share, and they
joined in the laugh and commendation. Lord Temple
desired his best and kindest compliments to you and
my cousin. He is not at all the worse for his late
illness.... Sir George and he were going to dine with
Mr. Pitt, whose health, I believe, is in much the same
state as when you saw him.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUCHESS OF CHANDOS</div>

<p>Mrs. Medows wrote on January 6 from Chute,
Wilton, then her brother-in-law’s residence, to wish the
Montagus a happy new year, and in this letter she
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Duke of C(handos)<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> our neighbour kept his
Son’s<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> birthday with great magnificence. I was invited,
and not foreseeing such an occasion for dress, I had
neither manto nor sack, and desired leave to come in a
white apron in the evening, but the Duchess insisted on
my coming with it to dinner. You may imagine how well
I dined on two and forty dishes, and a dessert of one and
twenty, very well ordered and served; but the Duchess’s
behaviour was really an entertainment, not in the least
embarrassed, she did the honours perfectly well, and
seemed conscious she should make a good figure, and
pleased with the opportunity. In the evening there was
a ball, cards for the grave people. I am pleased to find
that I can still see the young people dance and with
pleasure; our nieces<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Pulses were the best dancers. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>won four rubbers and past for a good player; content

<div class="sidenote">THE POET GRAY</div>

<p>January 18, Miss Anstey, writing from Trumpington,
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Have you heard that Mr. Gray<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> is going to publish
his whole stock of poetry, which, though it will consist
of only one volume, and contains but few things which
have not been already printed, the price will be half a
guinea; but what seems most extraordinary, it is expected
there will be a very great demand for them, and
I am told there is already a great number bespoke, for
they are to be embellished and illustrated in the most
curious and ingenious manner with copper plates drawn
and imagined by Mr. Bentley.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> I hear they are all very
clever, and was told for a specimen that the little ode on
the cat is to have in the frontispiece the Fates cutting
her nine threads of her life, and the rats and mice exulting
upon the death of their enemy. At the end Puss is
represented as just landed from Charon’s Boat, and in
her approach towards Pluto’s Palace, she sets up her
back and spits at Cerberus. How do you like the conceit?
They are said to be very highly drawn, and Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Gray gives his poetry. Mr. Horace Walpole<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> is at the
whole expense of the printing and copper plates for the
benefit of Mr. Bentley....</p>

<p>“I hear the scholar<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of St. John’s who has admitted
himself of the play house performs much better in a
personated than he did here in his real character. I
suppose he does not regret his being expelled the
University, as he finds himself well received by the
Town, for excommunication would not hurt him there.
I hear he is really a good actor, which is a thing, I am
afraid, much more rare than a bad clergyman, so I am
glad he has taken to the stage instead of the Pulpit. I
hear there were fourscore of this University present at
his first performance, and that if he has a benefit the
whole body will be present at it.”</p>

<p>Mr. West, attacked by his enemy the gout, was now
a prisoner at Wickham. On January 24, in a long letter,
these paragraphs are of interest—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The joyous Berenger passed five days with us last
week, read to us a play in Shakespeare and the <cite>‘Volpone’
of B. Johnson</cite>, and repeated innumerable scraps
out of a hundred others, laughed a great deal, said many
droll and some witty things, and then disappear’d, after
promising to come frequently to strut upon the little
stage of Wickham, which you may perceive has been
lately graced with almost as great a variety of characters
as are exhibited at Drury Lane, so that we have
little occasion to run to the great city in search of
company, much less for the sake of society, which indeed
there is almost lost, in the various bustle of Resort,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>the busy hum of Men, the embarrassments of Hoops,—Interruptions
of Messages and ostentatious dinners and
Drums, Trumpets, Politics, etc., etc.,—but besides the
pleasures of social converse, we have had amusements of
a stiller kind furnished by the obliging civility of some of
my brother Authors; among which are two new papers,
‘<cite>The Adventurer</cite>’ and ‘<cite>The World</cite>,’<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> by Adam Fitz-Adam.
The writer of the former sent me the first 14
numbers with a very handsome letter. To the other I
had indeed a kind of right since I am inform’d that the
judicious Tasters of the Town have declared it to be
written by Sir G(eorge) L(yttelton), by Mr. Pitt, or
your humble servant; with how much sagacity this
opinion is form’d I shall leave you to judge, for I doubt
not but this character will recommend them to your
perusal, as it precludes me saying anything in their
favour: of the former I may be so free as to declare I
like them very well, but I will be still bolder in recommending
to you <cite>Dr. Leland’s ‘Observations of Lord
Bolingbroke’s letter,’</cite> which was sent me by the author
yesterday, and which I have read through with great
pleasure and edification. I must transcribe a part of my
boy’s<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> letter about the death of the Bishop of Cloyne:
‘We have had a great loss at Oxford; the poor Bishop
of Cloyne died on Sunday about 8 o’clock in the
evening. Mrs. Berkeley<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> was sitting by him, and spoke
to him several times, and he never answered, so it is
supposed he was dead a quarter of an hour before it
was discovered, for he died without a groan or any sign
of pain.’</p>

<p>“He has received Rollin, for which I thank you in
his name.”</p>

<p>“How happy was the Bishop of Cloyne’s exit, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>rather entrance, one should call it into another, than
departure out of this life, for it had none of the agonising
pangs of farewell. I pity poor Mrs. Berkeley, who had
so little preparation for so heavy a stroke. I hope the
constant conversation and example of a man so eminent
in every Christian virtue may have given her an uncommon
degree of fortitude and patience. I have heard
her temper and understanding highly commended. She
had a perfect adoration of the Bishop.... Dr. Berkeley
had formerly made his addresses to Mrs. Donnellan:
what were her reasons for refusing him I know not,
friends were consenting, circumstances equal, her opinion
captivated, but perhaps aversion to the cares of a
married life, and apprehensions from some particularities
in his temper hinder’d the match; however their friendship
always continued, and I have always heard her
give him for virtues and talents the preference to all
mankind.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE VAPOURS</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu continues that she had neither health
nor spirits to read with pleasure. “The misfortunes I
have suffered and those I have feared have worn me out;
after the various turns of hope and fear on my poor
Lydia’s account, I am at last in despair about her. Mr.
Botham sent to us for a milch ass for her some days
ago.” After a long lamentation on Lydia’s behalf, she
ends, “I am that poor little selfish animal, a human
creature, made more poor, more little, more selfish
by the Vapours; in all Sir Hans’ Museum there is
not so ugly a monster as a woman in Vapours.” Lydia
becoming worse, Mrs. Montagu wrote to inform her
sister, Mrs. Laurence Sterne, whose curious letter I
give in full as a specimen of her style. Both she
and her sister Lydia wrote large, legible hands, much
alike.</p>

<p>“I return you my sincere and hearty thanks for
the Favour of your most welcome letter; which had I received
in a more happy Hour, wou’d have made me almost
Frantick with Joy; for being thus cruelly separated
from all my Friends, the least mark of their kindness

Delight. But the Dismal Account I receiv’d at the

Incapable of Joy, nor can I ever know Comfort till I

mistaken than when you imagine that Time and Absence
remove you from my Remembrance. I do assure you I
do not so easily part with what affords me so great Delight,
on the Contrary I spare no pains to improve every
little accident that recalls you to my Remembrance, as
the only amends which can be made me for those Unhappinesses
my Situation deprives me of. As a proof
of this I must inform you that about three weeks ago I
took a long Ride Through very bad weather, and worse
Roads, merely for the satisfaction of enjoying a Conversation
with a Gentleman who though unknown to
you had conceiv’d the highest opinion of you from the
perusal of several of your Letters, for which he was indebted
to Mrs. Clayton. Had this Gentleman nothing
else to recommend him, it certainly would be Sufficient
to have made me desirous of his acquaintance; but he
is both a Man of Sense and good Breeding, so that I am
not a little pleas’d with my new Acquaintance. Your
Supposition of my Sister’s having Boasted to me of her
Children is doubtless extremely Natural, I wish it had
been as Just: But I can in three words inform you of
all I know about ’em,—to wit their number and their
Names, for which I am indebted to Johnny. Had my
Lydia been so obliging as to have made them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Subject of her Letters, I shou’d by this time have had a
tolerable Idea of them, by considering what she said
with some abatement: but as it is I no more know
whether they are Black, Brown or Fair, Wise, or other
wise, Gentle, or Froward than the Man in the Moon.
Pray is this strange Silence on so Interesting a Subject
owing to her profound Wisdom or her abundant Politeness?
But be it to which it will, as soon as she recovers
her Health I shall insist on all the satisfaction she can
give on this head. In the meantime I rejoice to find
they have your approbation and am truly thankful that
Nature has done her part, which indeed is the most
Material, though I frankly own I shall not be the first
to Forgive any slights that Dame Fortune may be dispos’d
to shew them.</p>

<p>Lydia Botham did not long survive; I do not know
the exact day of her death, but West, writing on
April 2, to Mrs. Montagu, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cannot conclude without thanking you, my dearest
Cousin, for informing me of your health, about which I
should have been under great alarms upon hearing of
Lydia’s Death, of which your letter brought me the first
intelligence. This kind attention to my happiness at a
time when your heart was overflowing with sorrow is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
such a proof of your regard for me I shall always
remember with gratitude.”</p>
</div>

<p>Though deeply lamented, Lydia’s sufferings, latterly
from asthma, dropsy, and a complication of disorders,
made her death more or less a release. Mr. Botham
was now left a widower with five children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LADY BATH’S ASSEMBLY</div>

<p>Writing from London, the end of April, to Sarah
Scott in John Street, Bath, where she and Lady Bab
were living, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been at Oratorios so crowded and plays so
hot I have almost fainted, but first of all crowds and
greatest of all mobs, I must in justice name Lady
Bath’s<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> assembly, from whence at hazard of life and limb
I broke away a little after one on Tuesday last. Her
ladyship had happily gathered together eight hundred
Christian souls, many of which had like to have perished
by famine and other accidents. I suffered the most
from the first of these; being ill, I had not eat a morsel
of dinner, and there was not a biscuit nor a bit of bread
to be got, and half the company got out through the
stables and garden. The house was not empty till near
3 in the morning.”</p>

<p>Writing to Mr. Montagu (who had gone to Sandleford

<div class="sidenote">“A PERFECT WOMAN”</div>

<p>Gilbert West from Wickham, on May 23, gives the
following account of Mr. Pitt, whose health had been
causing much anxiety to his friends—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Had I answered your letter last night I should
have given you a good account of Mr. Pitt, who was
yesterday in better spirits than I have seen him in since
he came hither, but I find by inquiring after him this
morning that he has had a bad, that is, a sleepless night,
which has such effect on his spirits that I am afraid we
shall see him in a very different condition to-day. This
has happened to him every other night since Friday
last, so I am persuaded there is something intermitting
in his case, of which neither the Physicians nor himself
seem to be aware. I think he ought to go to town to
consult with them, but to this he has so great an aversion
that I question if he will comply with our request. Sir
George Lyttelton, who saw him on one of his bad days,
Saturday last, promised to come hither to-day, and his
voice added to ours may possibly prevail....</p>

<p>“Mr. Pitt express’d a due sense of your goodness
in inquiring so particularly after him, and that you may
know how high you stand in his opinion, I must inform
you that in a conversation with Molly he pronounced
you the most <i>perfect woman</i> he ever met with.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">MR. PITT’S INSOMNIA</div>

<p>Mr. Pitt was recommended by his doctors to go to
Tunbridge Wells to drink the waters. Accompanied
by Mr. West, Mrs. West, and Miss West, he set off
on May 26. West, writing to Mrs. Montagu, says—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">
“Tunbridge Wells, May 27, 1753.</p>
<p class="greet5">“<span class="smcap">My dearest Cousin! My best and most valuable
Friend!</span></p>

<p>“Your kind letter which I received on coming
from Chapel is the most agreeable thing I have met
with at Tunbridge, where we arrived last night about 7,
after only stopping at Sen’nocks, and dining at Tunbridge
Town. It came very seasonably to relieve my
spirits which were much sunk by the extreme dejection
which appears to-day in Mr. Pitt, from a night passed
entirely without sleep, notwithstanding all the precautions
which were taken within doors to make it
still and quiet, and the accidental tranquillity arising
from the present emptiness and desolation of this place,
to which no other invalids, except ourselves are yet
arrived, or even expected to arrive as yet. He began to
drink the waters to-day, but as they are sometimes very
slow in their operations, I much fear both he and those
friends who cannot help sympathizing with him, will
suffer a great deal before the wished-for effect will take
place, for this <i>Insomnium</i> his Physicians have prescribed
Opiates, a medicine which, in this case, though they may
procure a temporary ease, yet often after recoil upon
the spirits. He seems inclined to take Musk, and intends
to talk with Molly about it. I think his Physicians have
been to blame in giving all their attention to the disorder
in his bowels, and not sufficiently regarding the Distemperature
of his spirits, a Disease much more to be
apprehended than the other; while he continues under
this Oppression, I am afraid it will be impossible for me
to leave him, as he fancies me of the greatest use to him
as a friend, and a comforter, but I hope in God he will
soon find some alteration for the better, of which I shall
be glad to give you the earliest information. In the
meantime I beg you will take care of your health, and
as the most effectual means of establishing it, I most
earnestly desire you will follow Mr. Montagu’s exhortations
to repair forthwith to Tunbridge, as by so doing
you will not only contribute to the regaining your own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>health, but to the comfort and felicity of some here who
love you.... Kitty, Molly and Mr. Pitt desire their
affectionate compliments. Molly begs you will communicate
this account of Mr. Pitt to Sir G(eorge)
L(yttelton).”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">RENT OF LODGINGS</div>

<p>In West’s next letter, of May 30, he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I think Mr. Pitt is somewhat better, tho’ his spirits
are too low to allow him to think so, and his nights are
still sleepless without the aid of Opiates. I write this
from the ‘Stone House’ to which we were driven by
the noisy situation of our house at the foot of Mount
Sion. How many pleasing ideas our present habitation
recalls I leave you to judge, though there needs
no such artificial helps to make you ever present to my
memory.... Mr. Pitt is lodged in your room, and I
in that which was Mr. Montagu’s dressing-room on the
ground floor.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Montagus and Wests together had rented the
“Stone House” the year before this. On May 31 West
writes to say he is leaving Mr. William Lyttelton with
Mr. Pitt, and will return to Wickham on Saturday, and
dine with Mrs. Montagu at Hayes <i>en route</i>. He adds,
“Mr. Pitt feels a little gout in his foot, which we hope
will increase so as to be an effectual Remedy for all
his disorders.”</p>

<p>On June 6, West, who had been commissioned to
find a house for Mrs. Montagu, looks at the last two left
on Mount Ephraim, a Mr. Spooner’s and a Mr. Sele’s;
he decided on the latter, orders the chimney to be made
higher, and a <i>hovel</i> put on it to stop smoking, and to
order the owners to lie in the beds to air them!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The price he told me was 4 guineas a week, or
thirty-five guineas for the whole season, that is till
Michaelmas, or a week or two over; for this price you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>are to have stabling for eight horses, and a coach house
for two carriages.... Mrs. West will be obliged to you
if you will bring her jewels with you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu arrived at Tunbridge on June 11, and
on the 13th writes to her husband, then in London,
to say</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“my cough is much abated, and my appetite increased:
the asses’ milk sits well on my stomach.... I have
a constant invitation to dinner at the ‘White House’;
Mr. Pitt is too ill to dine abroad, and the Wests
cannot leave him, so as often as I am disposed for
company, I dine there; the rest of my time passes in
taking air and exercise, and now and then the relief of
a book.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CANVASSING</div>

<p>On account of the Jew Bill and other unpopular
measures coming before Parliament, a General Election
was anticipated, and Lord Sandwich was already arranging
for it by canvassing his constituents, and those
at Huntingdon, and summoned Mr. Montagu to meet him
at Hinchinbrooke the second week in August. Previous
to this he spent a few days with his wife at Tunbridge
hence proceeding to Yorkshire for his annual estate
business. Old Mr. Robinson accompanied his friend,
Sir Edward Dering, to canvass for him in Kent, and his
daughter says, “My Father would have made a good
counterpart to Sir Edward Dering; if <i>bon mots</i> could
carry a county, I know few that would care to contend
with them.”</p>

<p>Previous to going to Tunbridge, Mrs. Montagu
placed her two young charges, Miss Carter and Miss
Botham, in a boarding-school. She writes to her sister
Sarah—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Montagu thought Miss Carter’s dancing would
be better improved if she went to School, and he is as
desirous she should be a fine dancer as if she was to be
a Maid of Honour. I was the more willing in regard to
Miss Botham going, for my cousin is of such a ‘diversian’
temper, as Cotes used to express it, that I feared she
would not be easily restrained in a place of this sort;
she is a fine girl, but so lively and so idle, she requires
infinite care. With great capacity of learning she has
prodigious desire to be idle, and thinks it quite hard
not to take her share of all the diversions she hears of.
On being asked how she liked London she said very
well, but should do so much better if she was to go to
Ranelagh every night! I have left them at a very good
school, but an expensive one; however, they are only
to stay there till the 15th of August, for then the school
breaks up, and if I do not leave this place sooner, they
must come. I believe no gouvernante ever took half
the pains I have done with these children, explaining to
them everything they read, and talking to them on all
points of behaviour.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">PENSHURST</div>

<p>On July 4, in a letter to Mr. Montagu, who was at
Theakstone, his wife writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All the family at the ‘Stone House’ and myself in
their train went yesterday to Penshurst; we spent a
good deal of time in viewing the pictures. I was most
pleased with the portraits, as I know not any family
that for Arts and Arms, greatness of courage and
nobility of mind have excelled the Sydney Race. Beauty
too, has been remarkable in it.”</p>
</div>

<p>And on July 8—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has been much the turn of the Society I am in to
go out in parties to see places, and last post day we
settled upon an expedition of this sort with such precipitation,
I had not opportunity to write without keeping
the company waiting. We went to see an old seat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of a Mr. Brown’s; it is well situated, was built by Inigo
Jones, has some fine portraits.... We went from this
venerable seat to a place called New Vauxhall, where
Mr. Pitt had provided us a good dinner; the view from
it is romantic; we staid there till the cool of the evening,
and then returned home. We drank tea yesterday
in the most beautiful rural scene that can be imagined,
which Mr. Pitt had discovered in his morning’s ride
about half a mile from hence; he ordered a tent to be
pitched, tea to be prepared, and his French horn to
breathe music like the unseen genius of the wood:
the company dined with me, and we set out, number 8....
Sir George Lyttelton and Mr. Bower are come to
spend a few days with Mr. Pitt.”</p>
</div>

<p>To this her husband replies, “I very much approve
of the excursions you make, and think the more the
better, as they both entertain the mind and give
exercise to the body.” He adds, the epidemic then
raging amongst cattle in England had not been so
severe on his northern property as in other parts of the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRINITY COLLEGE LIBRARY</div>

<p>Mr. Pitt went to Hastings for two days, and on his
return, Mr. West made a tour to Canterbury, Dover,
etc., which lasted five days. Dr. Smith,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Mr. Montagu’s
old friend, was then at Tunbridge, and Mrs. Montagu
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We fell into discourse upon some embellishments
and ornaments to be added to the fine Library at Trinity
College. There are to be 26 Bustos put up, 13 in

be cast in plaister of Paris: but Mrs. Middleton talks of
a fine Marble Busto of Dr. Middleton to be done by
Roubilliac,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which I think very proper, as he was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>

<div class="sidenote">GIBSIDE</div>

<p>After seeing to the business consequent on his
trusteeship to his cousin, Mr. Rogers, of Newcastle,
Mr. Montagu had returned to Theakstone on July 29.
He describes Gibside, the seat of Mr. Bowes<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I dined this day sennight at Gibside; it was one of
the finest summer days I ever saw. It set off to great
advantage the whole vale through which the river Tyne
runs, which consists of a great deal of good rich land.
The Moors, tho’ not so pleasing to the eye, make abundant
amends by the riches of the mines. All the gentlemen
are planting and adorning their Seats, but nothing
comes up to the grandeur and magnificence of what Mr.
Bowes has done, and is a (<i>sic</i>), doing, I mean without
doors, for his house is but an indifferent one. It stands
in the midst of a great wood of about 400 acres, through
which there are a great many noble walks and rides
interspers’d with fine lawns, with a rough river running
thro’ it, on each side of which are very high rocks, which
gives it a very romantick look. Mr. Bowes is at present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
upon a work of great magnificence, which is the erecting
a column of above 140 feet high. This, as far as I
know, may be the largest that ever was erected by a
subject in this Island, and may yield to nothing but the
Monument at London. I ought not to omit telling you
that he has already erected upon a rising ground a
gothick building which he calls a Banquetting room,
in which the night before there was a concert of Musick
(<i>sic</i>), at which Jordain and an Italian woman performed,
whom Mrs. Lane<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> brought with her from Bramham
Moor, from which she came in a day.... On Monday
I dined with Sir Thomas Clavering.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This gentleman’s
house is very old and bad, but the situation good and
prospect pleasant. He has made a long road leading to
his house and improved his park, and made a serpentine
river.... He has also, as well as all the other gentlemen
in that county, made a kitchen garden with very
high walls, planted with the finest fruit trees. I question
not peaches and nectarines may succeed very well,
but for grapes they must be beholden to fire.”</p>

their school. Another excursion to Stonelands<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> with
Mr. Pitt took place, and in a letter to Mr. Montagu on
August 3 we learn—</p>

<p>In the afternoons Mrs. Montagu and Mr. Pitt were
attending Mr. King’s lectures on philosophy, etc., and
“Mr. Pitt, who is desirous of attaining some knowledge
in this way, makes him explain things very precisely.”
In another letter she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Miss Carter will excell in dancing. I did not think
it right she should dance Minouets at the ball till she
was quite perfect in it, but Mr. West, Mr. Pitt and all
their family and some other company were here the
other day, and I made her dance a Minouet with Master
West by way of using her to do it in company; she
acquitted herself so well as to get great commendation.”</p>
</div>

<p>As usual, the husband and wife exchanged loving
letters on the anniversary of their wedding-day,
August 5. Mrs. Montagu mentions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is a report that Lord Coke is dying; his
wife, Lady Mary, is here; she is extremely pretty, her
air and figure the most pleasing I ever saw. She is
not properly a beauty, but she has more <i>agrémens</i> than
one shall often see. With so many advantages of birth,
person and fortune, I do not wonder at her resentment
being lively, and that she could ill brook the neglects
and insults of her husband.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Mary was the daughter of the 2nd Duke of
Argyll and Duke of Greenwich. She is often mentioned
by Horace Walpole. Her husband treated her with
great brutality, and she gained a separation from him.

this was the uncle of the 6th Earl of Carnarvon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of Highclere Castle, Hants. Mr. Montagu says, “He
has done a great deal to adorn and beautify Highclere;
he had designed to do much more, if he dies it will want
his finishing hand.” On August 13 Mrs. Montagu

himself so concealed that he may on any project be able

It is said in case of a Minority he will make us a visit.
Lord Rochford intercepted a letter from a Cardinal in
France to his brother in Italy, in which he said he had

</div>

<p>These excursions were much encouraged by Mr.

<p>Mr. Montagu joined his wife for a week at Tunbridge,
when he had to return to London. On September 16
she writes to him—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I intend to be with you on Thursday.... I find
Mr. Pitt has some intentions, as <i>I told you when you was
here, of going to Heys</i>, in case he should not be well
enough to take the long journey he intends, and he
seems much pleased that I will lend him that little
tenement; but as I apprehend a feather bed more will
be wanted than used to be, I propose to send one from
Hill Street.... Mr. Pitt leaves this place to-morrow,
he is now going to Dr. Ascough’s, and from thence to

<p>The next letter to Gilbert West I transcribe in
portions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Sandleford, September 27, 1753.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">My most honoured Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“Your kind and agreeable letter restored me in
some measure to the temper I lost at going out of town
the very day you came to it. I know not what poets
may find in the country, when they have filled the woods
with sylvan Deities, and the rivers with Naides; but to
me groves and streams and plains make poor amends
for the loss of a friend’s conversation. You have better
supplied Mr. Pitt’s absence by reading the Orations of
his predecessor, Demosthenes, and I can easily imagine
you would rather have passed the evening with the
British than the Grecian Demosthenes, whom in talents
perhaps he equals, and in grace of manners and the
sweet civilities of life, I dare say he excels. But when
you seem to say you would even have preferred the
simple small talk of your poor cousin to the Athenian
Orator, I cry out,—Oh wondrous power of friendship,
which like the sun gives glorious colours to a vapour,
and brightens the pebble to a gem, till what would have
been neglected by the common herd is accepted by the
most distinguished.... On Tuesday morning about
eight o’clock I called upon Mr. Hooke at his hermitage.
I found him like a true Savant surrounded by all the
elements of Science, but though I roamed round the
room, I could not perceive any signs of the Author,
no papers, pen, ink, or sheets just come from the press.
I fear the fine ladies and fine prospects of Cookham
divert his attention from the Roman History.... I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
desired him to carry me to Mrs. Edwin’s, which I heard
was a pretty place.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> There is an old ferry woman who
crosses the Thames very often before Mrs. Edwin’s
terrace.... While we were in Mrs. Edwin’s garden he
betrayed my name to her ... she came down, showed
me her house and the pictures, which are very fine, but
the views from her windows gave one no leisure to
consider the works of art.... Cliefden Hill rises
majestically in view, and the only flat shore you see
from this place lies straight before it, and is a large
plain of the finest verdure and full of cattle.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WICKHAM URN</div>

<p>To this letter Gilbert West replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am glad your journey to Sandleford was relieved
by the agreeable digression you made to Cookham,
where I hope to find, at least in the memory of Mr.
Hooke, the vestiges of your having been there, which
will be an additional motive to me to make him a visit
from Stoke, for I am going once more from Wickham,
notwithstanding the neighbourhood of Sir Thomas
Robinson,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> the Archbishop,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and Bower, and the arrival
of my Urn, which is to come this very day, and which
Mr. Cheer hath taught me to consider as an emblem and
monument of the polished, elegant and accomplished
Mrs. Montagu, by assuring me ‘that it is indebted for all
the extraordinary and highly finished ornaments he hath
bestowed upon it, to the great regard and veneration he
hath for her, and that he will not either for love or money
make such another.’ ... I was paying a visit at Fulham,
where I enjoyed the smiles of my beloved Bishop,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the
presence of Mrs. Sherlock, and the agreeable conversation
of Mrs. Chester, with the more substantial delicacies
of an excellent English Venison Pasty.”</p>

<p>Further on he says he is going to Lillingston Dayrell
to see his mother, Lady Langham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW POST-CHAISE</div>

<p>In the next letter (Oct. 3) from Sandleford to Mr.
West occurs this sentence, “Mr. Montagu returned
hither on Monday with the new four-wheeled post-chaise;
it is the pleasantest machine imaginable in
rough roads, but I think it too easy on even roads.”
The coachmen had nothing intermediate between the
two-wheeled vehicles and the ponderously long six-
or four-horsed coach, which required elaborate skill in
turning.</p>

<p>Staying again at Fulham, Mr. West mentions that
he has been urging Bishop Sherlock to publish some
of his sermons, which he promised to do. West had
a fresh attack of the gout, which made him return
home. Mr. Pitt had left Hayes suddenly for Bath,
Tunbridge waters not having been of sufficient use to
him; and in a letter of October 13, to West, in capital
letters, her inquiries not being answered, Mrs. Montagu
asks, “I desire <span class="allsmcap">TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD
CONCERNING MR. PITT’S HEALTH</span>?” Describing her daily
life, she says she keeps up the Tunbridge habit of
driving an hour or so after dinner (which, it must be
remembered, was then early) over the adjacent common;
after these airings she drank tea, and retired to her
dressing-room for two or three hours of reading.</p>

<p>On October 14 West writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Duke and Duchess of Portland, with two of
their daughters, dined here last Thursday, and we are
to make them a morning’s visit to-morrow at Bullstrode.
Her Grace was extremely courteous and obliging to me,
but never made any inquiry after you, which piqued me
so much, that I put her against her upon talking about
Mr. Botham, and from what she said about the distrest
situation of his family, took occasion to extol you as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
most generous and sincere friend, and indeed the only
one the poor man could depend on.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">LADY BUTE</div>

<p>The reader will have doubtless missed the frequent
mention of the duchess and her letters. There is no
doubt that the coolness between the quondam intimate
friends was on account of the Scott separation. It will
be remembered the duchess sided with Mrs. Scott’s
engagement against Mrs. Montagu’s opinion. After the
Scott separation, probably influenced by her intimate
friend, Lady Bute, who with the Princess of Wales
seems to have defended him,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the duchess appears to
have taken his part; but his true character is shown
by the fact that the Prince of Wales (George <abbr title="the Third"><abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr></abbr>), on
being given a Household in 1756, begged that Scott<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
should not be continued about him, and to make up
for this dismissal he was given a commissionership in
the Excise. Later on the duchess and Mrs. Montagu
had a <i>rapprochement</i>, but the letters were never as
cordial as in previous times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BULLSTRODE MENAGERIE</div>

<p>Writing from Lillingston on October 27, West describes
his visit to Bullstrode—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was very kindly received both at Bullstrode and
Cookham; at the former we were shown a great many
fine and great many curious things, both in doors and
without; the day proved too cold, and I was not enough
recovered to see all the rarities of the animal as well as
the vegetable kind, which were dispersed over the Park
and gardens. Those that might be seen from the windows,
as some spotted Sheep and a little Bull from Fort
St. David’s, whose resemblance I have often seen in
China ware, I beheld with admiration and applause, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>ventured two steps into the garden to take a view of the
orange trees against the wall.... Her Grace promised
to make me a present of some trained up for that purpose.
In her closet we were shown some curious works
in Shells, performed by Mrs. Delany, whom her Grace
expected at Bullstrode in a short time, and expressed
great pleasure and not a little impatience in the prospect
of seeing so dear and so ingenious a friend. Of you she
said nothing, till upon her naming Mrs. Donnellan, I
said I could give her some account of her, having been
informed by you that she was gone to town; she then
asked when I heard from you, and where you was, but
carried her enquiry after you no further. At Cookham
I spent some hours with Mrs. Stanley, for Mr. Hooke
had gone out with Mrs. Edwin to make a visit to Dr.
Freind....” He further states that he found his
mother well, and “very little alter’d since I last saw
her, excepting that she has grown a little fatter, a
circumstance to a woman of seventy is greatly preferable
to wrinkles. In my way thro’ Stowe Park I met
Miss Banks riding out with Lord Vere,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of her I
enquired much about Mr. Pitt, and received from her
the same answer, which I must have made for your
enquiries after him, that they had heard nothing of him
since he left Stowe.... While he staid at Stowe he
was in good health and spirits, he went from thence
to Hagley, and she believed he intended to go from
Hagley to Bath.”</p>

<p>On November 10 Mrs. Donnellan, to whom Mrs.
Montagu had lent her house in Hill Street, whilst she
searched for lodgings in the suburbs, her lungs not
permitting her to live in the town during the winter,
writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have taken a little house on tryal at Kensington
Gravel Pits ... both Richardson’s house at Northend
and Mrs. Granville’s at Chelsey I think too low for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>me.... I want you to read ‘Sir Charles Grandison,’
it is not formed on your plan of banishing delicacy. I
am afraid it carrys it too far on t’other side, and is too
fine spun, but there are fine things and fine characters
in it, and I don’t know how it is, but his tediousness
gives one an eagerness to go on; there is a love-sick
madness that I think extremely fine and touching, but
if you have not read it I must not forestall. I think I
will own to you, the great fault of my friend’s writings,
there is too much of everything. I really laughed at
your nursery of ‘Clarissas,’ but I hope you did not think
of me as the old nurse, there was nobody there while I
stayed!”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">“SIR CHARLES GRANDISON”</div>

<p>Mr. Richardson had just completed his novel of
Sir Charles Grandison. The Clarissas is an allusion
to Miss Botham and Miss Carter, then with Mrs.
Montagu.</p>

<p>This same month Mrs. Montagu was again very
unwell. West urged her to go to London, but Mr.
Montagu, who loved the retirement at Sandleford, was
unwilling to leave it, and she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tho’ I am told I may go to town, I know it would
not be agreeable where I ought to please, and I can
hardly think it right to be in such haste to quit the place
where I live most in the manner I ought to do, where
only I am useful. I relieve the distresses and animate
the industry of a few, and have given all my hours to
the two girls under my care, whose welfare, whose
eternal welfare perhaps, depends on what they shall
now learn.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Hooke and Mr. Botham were both at Sandleford.
In Mr. Hooke’s conversation Mrs. Montagu found much
enjoyment; as West put it, “He (Hooke) is a very
worthy man, and has in him the greatest compass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
entertainments of any one I know, from nonsense (as
Lord Bath calls it), to sense, and beyond sense to
Metaphysics.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE TRIUMPHS OF THE GOUT”</div>

<p>On December 20 Mrs. West writes to present her
Christmas wishes, and Mr. West’s, to the Montagus, as
“Tubby” (Mr. West), as was his uneuphonious family
nickname, had the gout in both hands. Mrs. Montagu
writes to him—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“The 27th of December, 1753.<br>
</p>

<p>“And what, my dear Cousin, are both hands prisoners
of the gout! such innocent hands too! Hands that
never open’d to receive or give a bribe, that never
dipped into the guilt of the South Sea fraud, of Charitable
Corporations, or pilfer’d lottery tickets, clean even
from perquisite in office, and the most modest means by
which the Miser’s palm wooes and sollicits gain. So far
have your hands been from grasping at other’s gold,
they have not held fast your own with a tenacious grip,
but open’d liberally at the petitions of the poor, for the
productions of Art, or to feast your friends at the genial
board. Most of all do I resent the fate of the writing
hand, which was first dedicated to the Muses, then with
maturer judgment consecrated to the Nymphs of Solyma,
and shall it be led captive by the cruel gout? Why did
you sing the triumphs<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> of the dire goddess? Oh, why
could you not describe them unfelt, as Poets often do

was appointed first Lord of the Treasury; Mr. Legge,
Mr. Botham’s uncle, Chancellor of the Exchequer; Sir
George Lyttelton, Cofferer. Mr. Montagu proceeded
to Hinchinbrooke early in April to canvass, and his

<p>Bower writes to Mrs. Montagu on April 16 from
Oakhampton, where he had gone with Sir George
Lyttelton for his election, in fervid Italian. He was
disgusted at the orgy of the election, and says that at
the election dinner given by the mayor and magistrates
in their robes to Sir George Lyttelton, they sat down
at 3 o’clock p.m., and none rose to leave till two in the
morning! “<span lang="it">e tutti, o quasi tutti partirono cordialmente ubbriachi</span>”
(“and all, <i>nearly</i> all, parted thoroughly drunk”).
He continues, “The cavaliers then went from house to
house to kiss the ladies, as was customary, and ask for
the votes of their husbands.” After fervid speeches made
to the “celeste imagine della Madonna del Monte e
della Strada del Monte” (the celestial image of the
Madonna of the Mount and the Madonna of Hill Street),
meaning Mrs. Montagu, his pen is taken up by Lyttelton,
who says, “The Italian language affords such lofty expressions,
as the poverty of ours will not come up to,
and therefore the Madonna must be content with my
telling her that the good Father with all his Devotion
does not honour her more than I do....” At the
end of his letter he says, “I hear from my wife that
my Boy has been with you: a thousand thanks for your
goodness to him.” This is the first mention of Thomas,
afterwards 2nd Baron Lyttelton, then only ten years
old. Lyttelton had early besought the interest and influence
of Mrs. Montagu for his son and daughter by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
his first marriage. Both became truly attached to her,
would that her influence had prevailed on “Tom” later
in life.</p>

<p>At this period Mrs. Donnellan was very ill, and Mrs.
Montagu did her best to nurse her. Lady Sandwich
came to town to inoculate her daughter, Lady Mary.
Miss Mary Pitt had been to see Mrs. Montagu, and “she
assures me Mr. Pitt is in good health, but has had another
attack of gout in his hand, owing, ’tis imagined, to his
being blooded for a sore throat.”</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu at this period sustained the heavy loss
of his faithful agent, the second Mr. Carter, who died at
Theakstone, and whose loss necessitated his immediate
journey to the north to attend to his own and Mr.
Rogers’ affairs, all of which had been confided to Mr.
Carter’s care. Taking Mr. Botham as his temporary
secretary and companion, they started off northward by
post-chaises, a most expensive process, as Mr. Montagu
called it. On June 13 Mrs. Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am sorry Mrs. Carter (the grandmother), has set
her heart so much on having her granddaughter with
her, she is of the proper age to receive instruction and
take impressions; a few years passed innocently will
not leave her as amiable a subject as she is now, her
mind will be less flexible.... Mr. Pitt drank tea with
me this afternoon; he has recovered his health entirely,
if one may judge by his looks. He tells me he has built
a very good house at Bath for £1200. He mention’d to
me his intention of going on Saturday to Wickham to
propose the place at Chelsea to Mr. West, the offer will
certainly be an agreeable one.”</p>
</div>

<p>This place was that of the paymaster to Chelsea
College. In the next letter to Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs.
Montagu says—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The place is call’d a thousand pounds a year, it is
in the gift of Mr. Pitt, and was given with grace that few
know how to put into any action ... they have excellent
lodgings annexed to the place.... Mr. Pitt dined with
them on Saturday; I imagine he was very happy, but
he so well deserved to be so. It is a fine thing to act
the part of Providence and bless the good. Miss Carter
was sent for by her old grandmother, last week she
left me.”</p>
</div>

<p>Writing to her husband on June 15, Mrs. Montagu
states she shall be glad to hear as soon as Mr. Montagu
thinks he will return, “that I may disfurnish Hayes,
which I shall quit as a man does a homely but a quiet
wife, with some little regret, but not much tender
sorrow; it is not a beautiful place, but it is quiet, and
when one steps out of the bustle of Town, appears on
that account amiable.” She adds that her sister’s health
is greatly improved, and her temper less petulant, on
account of having taken to a milk and vegetable diet.</p>

<p>On July 9 Mrs. Montagu mentions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My brother Robinson came to town last night; he
dined here to-day, and we are all going to Vauxhall,
where Mr. Tyers has had the ruins of Palmyra painted
in the manner of the scenes so as to deceive the eye and
appear buildings.”</p>
</div>

<p>Her sister Sarah and brother Charles were with her.
She concludes with an affectionate appeal to her husband
not to apply himself too much to business at Newcastle,
but to take exercise for his health’s sake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. WEST’S APPOINTMENT — ELIZABETH CANNING</div>

<p>In another letter undated, but about this period, as it
mentions West’s thanks to Mr. Montagu for his congratulations
on his appointment to Chelsea Hospital,
allusion is made to Elizabeth Canning, whose curious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>story of having been kidnapped<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and ill-treated had
convulsed London opinion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The town is in great agitation about Elizabeth
Canning; she is condemn’d to Transportation, but her
guilt is so far from appearing certain, that the Sheriffs
refuse to conduct her among the other felons. All the
Aldermen but Sir Crispe Gascoigne<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> petition in her
behalf, all the great officers of the State almost, interpose
for her, and the Archbishop of Canterbury also
desires that she may have a decent person of her own
sex to attend her over, and then to board in a private
family. Some fear there will be a rising of the Mob in
her favour; in general all seem to agree that the matter
is entirely doubtful. As to Sir Crispe Gascoigne he dare
not stir without being guarded.... I wish the whole
affair was brought to light, there is great iniquity
somewhere.”</p>

<p>On July 19, writing from Hayes, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Miss Mary Pitt, youngest sister of Mr. Pitt, is come
to stay a few days with me, she is a very sensible, modest,
pretty sort of young woman, and as Mr. Pitt seem’d to
take every civility shown to her as a favour, I thought
this mark of respect to her one manner of returning my
obligations to him.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu and Mr. Botham proceeded to Newcastle
to regulate Mr. Rogers’ affairs, which, as before
mentioned, required attention, owing to the death of
the head agent, Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>In consequence probably of worry, Mr. Montagu
returned from the north at the end of July with a fever,
“which,” as his wife writes to Sarah, “bleeding and
wormwood draughts have taken off,” and as soon as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>was fit he was to go with her to Hayes to pack up her
books. Miss Anstey was staying with them, and was
to accompany them to Sandleford. Mention is made
of a portrait of herself which Mrs. Montagu was going
to send Mrs. Scott: “Mr. Cambridge call’d on me the
other day, he spoke much in your praise. I told him
I hoped he would call on you at Bath, he promised he
would.” This was Richard Owen Cambridge,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> a friend

<p>Writing to West from Sandleford of her neighbours
at Hayes, she regrets the society of Mrs. Herring and
the Archbishop,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and desires her regards to them. He
answers—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="sidenote">BRIGHTHELM&shy;STONE</div>

<p>At the beginning of September, through the influence
of West, the Bishop of London gave the living of Ealing
to Mr. Botham. Botham was at Brighthelmstone with
his two boys for sea-bathing, as they were not in health.
The joy of Mrs. Montagu was great at this preferment,
as the bishop permitted Mr. Botham to continue to hold
Albury as well, placing a curate in the living he did not
occupy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“PRECIEUSES RIDICULES”</div>

<p>Writing again to West, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Mangey kept a curate at Ealing as he did not
reside there, but undoubtedly Mr. Botham will discharge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>the duties of the living he resides at without assistance;
the Bishop of London required Mr. Botham’s residence:
as the girls and boys are growing up and must soon live
with him, they will be better placed at Ealing in a good
neighbourhood than at Albury. They will learn nothing
there but eating and drinking plentifully of Lord Aylesford,
and Mr. Godschall’s house is generally full of
poetic Misses, who are addressing each other by the
names of Parthenia, Araminta, etc., with now and then
a little epistle to Strephon or Damon. I was uneasy
whenever they were at home, for fear they should enter
into the <i>precieuse</i> character of Mrs. Godschall.”</p>
</div>

<p>This style of conversation is taken off in <cite>Molière’s
“Precieuses Ridicules.”</cite></p>

<p>West’s mother, Lady Langham was now paying her
son a visit. Mrs. Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I think the vast territories of imagination could not
afford any view so pleasing as the meeting of such a son
and such a mother; the pictures not only pleased my
mind, but warm’d my heart ... that you may at Lady
Langham’s age be as well able to take a journey, and
your son as well deserve, and as joyfully receive such a
visit is my sincerest and most earnest wish ... another
pleasure attends you all, and which your benevolence
and not your pride will feel, that of setting an example of
those various charities, of parent, child, husband and wife,
which make the happiness of domestic life; and there is
surely more honour in filling well <i>the circle mark’d of
Heaven</i> in these spheres of relation, than in running the
wild career of Ambition in its most shining track.
Indeed there is no part of a conduct that so certainly
deserves our approbation as an acquittance of family
regards. Actions of a public nature often are inspired
by vanity, domestic behaviour has not popular applause
for its object, tho’ with the sober judgment, as Mr. Pope
says of silence, ‘<i>its very want of voice makes it a kind of
fame</i>.’”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>
<p>She then proceeds to thank West eloquently for
Botham’s presentation to <i>Kingston</i> (this must be a mistake
for Ealing), and ends with desiring some paper hangings
“she and Mrs. Isted had laboriously adorned” to be taken
down with care at her house at Hayes, but leaves the rest
of the hangings to the landlord. “I presume some
retail grocer, haberdasher of small wares, or perhaps a
tallow chandler, will shortly be in possession of my
Castle at Hayes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. HATELEY</div>

<p>At Sandleford were staying young Mr. Hateley, an
artist, and Miss Anstey. The latter being in treaty for a
house in London, accepted Mr. Montagu’s escort thither,
and Mr. Hateley wishing to accompany them a portion
of the way, mounted a horse, which flung him at the first
start off and grievously cut and bruised him. The
doctor was summoned after the departure of Mr. Montagu
and Miss Anstey, who “blooded him, and he was
ordered to take no food but balm tea lest he should
have a fever.... The Harvest Home Supper last night
was very jolly, the guests had as good appetite as those
who meet to eat Turtle,” writes Mrs. Montagu to her
husband on September 23.</p>

<p>Miss Anstey, having lost her parents, and Trumpington
having become her brother’s property, had determined
to live in London. She took Mr. Montagu to
help her in choosing a residence in Queen Street, a new-built
house for £800. Miss Anstey executed several
commissions for Mrs. Montagu, amongst which she
mentions, “I have sent several prints of Nun’s habits,
some one of which I hope may become the beautiful
Eloise, and I shall very much rejoice to hear she has
taken the Veil.”</p>

<p>Mention is made in a previous letter of Mrs.
Montagu’s of Hateley painting a picture of Eloise, but
who sat for it I cannot say. Hateley recovered from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>his accident. A new post-chaise had been ordered for
the Montagus, and Mr. Montagu found it “nothing
showy or brilliant,” but his wife assures him, “I shall
find no fault with the plainness of the post-chaise,
neatness being all that is aimed at.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LILLINGSTON DAYRELL</div>

<p>West, writing on October 8 from Wickham, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have the honour to agree with my dearest and
most excellent cousin in looking upon writing letters as
one of the evils of Human Life, and for that reason I

to it by the great Mr. Pope.... I am now turning my
thoughts towards Chelsea, where I hope to be settled

all her chickens at once under her wings, but she
will have them by turns.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Medows writes from Chute on October 16 to
Mrs. Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am impatient to wait on you; all the horses and

now I hope to hire a couple of cart-horses: I dare not
venture with a common postboy and horses, because
the postboys are not used to a four-wheeled chaise, nor
the Road I must go.... I wish you joy of a pleasure
for life at least, the good you have done to Mr. Botham
and his family.... I am pleased you have hired the
wood, now one may walk in the bowling green without
coveting what is your neighbour’s. I hope hiring is a
step to purchasing; laying field to field is a natural

Newbury Wash, and Greenham Heath.”</p>

<p>Sarah Scott and Lady Bab Montagu had taken a
house at Bath Easton for use in the summer, and
desiring plants for the garden there, Mrs. Montagu
sends on November 6 to them a vast number of pinks,
roses and honeysuckles, together with a home-cured
ham. In the accompanying letter she mentions Ealing
being</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“two hundred pounds a year, his house a very pretty
one, a good garden with a great deal of wall fruit, and
there is a neighbourhood of genteel people, who have all

<p>To this Sarah writes on November 17, to thank her

returned to Bath for the winter, Bath Easton being too
near the water for them. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Have I sent you word of a subscription making for
Nash? I believe it began since I wrote last. It is
entitled a subscription for a ‘History of Bath and
Tunbridge for these last 40 years,’ by Richard Nashe,
Esqre., with an Apology for the Author’s life. The
whole money, two guineas, is to be paid down at once,
for he does not pretend any book is to come out. Some
have subscribed 10 guineas, many five, and a great many
hundred pounds are already subscribed. It is to be
kept open for life, and people give to him who will not
part with a guinea to relieve the greatest real and unmerited
distress imaginable. The pretence is that he
has but little more than £200 a year, which is not supposed
true, but if it was, surely it is full equal to his
merits, whether one considers them as moral or entertaining.
To such ladies as have secret histories belonging
to them, he hints that he knows every one’s private life
and shall publish it. This place grows so full of subscriptions
that no person of moderate fortune will long
be able to come to it. The people of the rooms are
endeavouring to obtain a subscription of half a guinea
each man, and a crown each woman for the season. As
yet it has not been complied with, but they require
it with such insolence, that I make no doubt it will
be complied with. I shall be glad to hear you are

<p>“Beau” Nash had reigned a despotic Master of the
Ceremonies over Bath for fifty years, living in a most
expensive style, mainly supported by his success at the
gaming tables. The Act of Parliament against gambling
put an end to his chief means of obtaining money. The
Corporation, however, settled a pension of 120 guineas
on him for his services. He was eighty-one years old
at this period, having been born in 1673. His rules for
general behaviour and manners are most amusing, but
are too long to insert.</p>

<p>At this time Mr. Pitt became engaged to Lady

Lyttelton’s.</p>

<p>On November 5 Mrs. Montagu writes to West—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“Since the days that Cupid set Hercules to the
distaff, he has not had a nobler conquest than over
the elevated soul of Mr. Pitt. I congratulate you on
the affinity, and I hope he will be happy: his long
acquaintance with the lady makes the hazard much less
than where people marry without knowing the disposition
of the person they choose. I believe Lady
Hester Grenville is very good-humoured, which is the
principal article in the happiness of the Marriage State.
Beauty soon grows familiar to the lover, wit may be
pernicious, and many brilliant qualities troublesome;
but a companion of gentle disposition softens cares and
lightens sorrows. The sober matches made on reflection,
are often happier than those made by sudden and violent
passion, and I hope this will prove of this kind; and
there is an authority in the character of Mr. Pitt, that
will secure him the deference and obedience of his wife;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
proud of him abroad, she will be humble to him at home;
and having said so much, I consign them over to Hymen,

<div class="sidenote">REV. W. WARBURTON — THOMAS HEARNE</div>

<p>In her next letter to West, of November 14, she
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As the Virtues and Graces as well as Cupid and
Hymen will assist at Mr. Pitt’s nuptials, I think he
could not choose a better place for their celebration
than Wickham, their capital seat. I wish them many
happy years together, and God bless them with health
and every good.... I hope while you are at Croydon
the good Archbishop will animate you to defy that foul
fiend my Lord Bolingbroke; I believe I shall take some
of Ward’s sneezing powder to clear my head of the impieties
and impurities of his book. I am not satisfied
with Mr. Warburton’s<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> answer, the levity shocks me,
the indecency displeases me, the <i>grossièreté</i> disgusts me.
I love to see the doctrine of Christianity defended by
the spirit of Christianity. When absurdity is mix’d
with impiety, it ceases to be a jest. I can laugh at his
Lordship’s cavils at Mr. Locke, his envy to Plato and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
all the old Philosophers, but I could with great seriousness
apply to him the words of his friend and Poet to the
Dunces—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But I must do his Lordship the justice to say that what
he wants in faith he makes up in confidence, for after
having assured you it is absurd to affirm God is just or
good, he declared he is willing to trust the being whose
attributes he cannot know, to dispose of him in another
world, not at all doubting that the Supreme Being will
be good to him, without goodness, and just to him without
justice! He laughs at the faith of Abraham, and I
should do so too, if Abraham had disputed God’s
veracity, and then trusted to His promises. I never read
such a mass of inconsistencies and contradictions, such
a vain ostentation of learning, and if I durst, I would say
it, all that can show ‘the trifling head, or the corrupted
heart.’ I think I may venture to say trifling, for whatever
does not relate to the argument is so, and to teize
the gentle reader with all the miserable sophisms

<p class="from s9">“Croydon, November 18, 1754.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“Your admirable letter found me at the Archiepiscopal
Palace at Croydon, where Mrs. West, Dick
and I had been ever since Wednesday; and it was
lucky that it found me there, as I had by that means an
opportunity of showing the Archbishop, whom you very
properly style good, your most ingenious and judicious
Reflections of Lord Bolingbroke’s pompous Rhetorical
and inconsistent Declamations with which his Grace
(who, by the bye agrees entirely with you in the censure
you there pass’d upon Mr. W(arburton)’s way of answering
him,) was so pleas’d that he desired me to give him
a copy of the whole paragraph, promising that if he
show’d it to anybody he would, however, cautiously
conceal the name of the author. After this I need not
tell you how much we both said in praise of you; I
shall only add that I, this morning, received his commands
to present his respects to you, and to tell you
in his name that if you allow’d yourself the liberty of
saying fine things of him, he would be even with you.
These are his own words, grounded on a piece of
information I had given him of the great honour and
esteem you had for him. We quitted Wickham, as I
told you, on Wednesday last, that we might throw no
obstacle in the way of that amorous impatience which
Mr. Pitt had in all his notes express’d of bringing Lady
Hester to our sweet and hospitable Habitation, as he
call’d it; but to our great surprise, and to the no small
mortification of Mrs. West in particular, who was afraid
that all the good things, with which she had fill’d her
larder, would be spoil’d by their delay—the happy
Bridegroom and his Bride did not arrive till Saturday,
on which morning they were married<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> by Dr. Ayscough<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
with the Archbishop’s License. They came down alone,
and have continued alone ever since, and, I imagine, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
continue during their stay at Wickham, in that Paradisaical
Solitude, tho’ by the quantity of provisions which
Mr. Campion<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> brought with him, and more which he has
since sent for from Croydon, we conclude he expected
some visitants from Town, as Lord Temple, etc.,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> but
having heard of no such visitants being expected, I
suppose that all this profusion was owing to Mr.
Campion’s solicitude to testify in his own way his
respects to his new Lady, and make his compliments
on this joyous occasion, in the polite, that is, in the
French Phraseology: this is all the intelligence I can
at present give you of this important affair, for we have
had no communication by messages, either to or from
Mr. Pitt, whom we were unwilling to disturb, or
interrupt the free course of those pleasures, which for a
time at least, possess the whole mind, and are most
relished when most private; for this reason I cannot
yet acquaint you when we shall leave Wickham, but
I believe it will be about the middle of this week,
and I suppose we shall not be able to go to Chelsea
before the latter end of the next, or the beginning of the
week after, and by that time I am still in hopes you will
come to Hill Street, and by giving me the pleasure of
seeing you there in good health, compleat the happy
change which you observe is already begun in the once
gloomy month of November. I do often, my dear
Cousin, look back with pleasure and thankfulness on
many incidents of my past Life, and compare them with
my present situation, so much changed for the better
in a thousand instances, such as Health, fortune and
Friendship, among which there is none that has given
me more happiness than yours, and which therefore I
hope will continue, till it is lost where only it can be
lost, in the brighter and warmer radiance of an unchangeable
and everlasting Society, where I hope to
have it continued to me through all eternity. I am
going to take the air with the good and amiable Archbishop,
and therefore must conclude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> January, 1755, but with no date of day, is a letter
of Mrs. Montagu’s to Sarah Scott on Lord Montfort<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
committing suicide after gambling heavily.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I imagine that you will be glad to hear the history
of the times, which indeed bring forth daily wonders;
nor is it the least that the most profound arithmetician
and the greatest calculator, one who carried Demoivre’s<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
‘<cite lang="fr">Probabilités de la Vie Humaine</cite>’ in his pocket, never
foresaw that spending ten times his income would ruin
his fortune, and that he found no way to make the book
of debtor and creditor even, but paying that debt which
dissolves all other obligations. You will guess I mean
Lord Montfort and his pistol. He had not discovered
any marks of insanity, on the contrary, all was deliberate,
calm and cool; having said so much of his indiscretion,
I think, with the rest of the world, I may acquit him of
the imputation of cunning and sharping, but what can
one say in defence of a conduct that had all the appearance
of deep knavery and the consequences of inconsiderate
rashness and folly.... Many reasons have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
been given for his Lordship’s violent act, but by what I
learn from those best acquainted with his person and
fortune, he was not under the pressure of any very
heavy debt, but had a true Epicurean character, loved a
degree of voluptuousness that his fortune could not
afford, and a splendour of life it could not supply,
much of his relish for the world was lost, and like
one that has no appetite to ordinary fare, chose to
rise from table unless fortune would make him a feast....
When Lord Montfort’s children were paid their
demands on his estate, I hear he had only £1200 a year
clear, and in table, equipage and retinue he equalled,
and in the first article perhaps excell’d, the largest fortunes.
To retrench or die was the question, he reasoned
like Hamlet, but left out the great argument of a future
state.”</p>

<p>In March occurs a long letter from Mrs. Pococke, of
Newtown, the very learned lady mentioned before. She
dispensed money for charitable purposes given by Mrs.
Montagu. She mentions that her son, Dr. Pococke, is
coming for a few days to see her before going abroad,
“probably for the last time, unless I live to the age of
the late Bishop of Man.” She mentions having walked
eight miles that day as an excuse for bad writing, which
was superfluous, as her handwriting is amazingly good
and clear, and she was between eighty and ninety!

<div class="sidenote">LORD BALTIMORE’S HOUSE</div>

<p>On June 9, presumably in this year, Mrs. Montagu
writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I suppose you know that Lady Sandwich has at
last left her kind Lord. To complete the measure of
his good usage, he keeps her daughter to educate
with the Miss Courtenays. I hope her Ladyship will
be happier than she has been for many years, she has
nothing to harass her but the apprehensions for Lady
Mary, but God knows that is a dreadful object. She
has taken a house at Windsor for the summer.” This
daughter died June 25, 1761.</p>
</div>

<p>And in the same month to Sarah Scott, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mrs. Boscawen and Miss Pitt came from Hatchlands
to London to spend two days with me; we went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Vauxhall each night, and Mrs. Anstey and I went with
them as far as Epsom: we saw Lord Baltimore’s house,
[<i>sic</i>] which speaks bad french, so I will not rehearse what
I saw there. Why should I teize your imagination with
strawberry colour’d wainscotts, doors of looking-glass,
fine landskips on gilt leather, and painted pastorals with
huge headed Chloes and gouty legg’d Strephons, with
french mottoes to explain those tender glances. We
were glad to quit this palace of bad taste for a little
arbor in the garden of the inn at Epsom. The Sunday
following Mr. Montagu and I went to dine with Mr.
Bower at Sidcop, his little habitation has the proper
perfections of a cottage, neatness, chearfulness, and an
air of tranquillity, a pretty grove with woodbines twining
round every Elm, a neat kitchen garden, with an
Arbor from whence you look on a fine prospect. Here
he may write of heresies and schisms, of spiritual pride
and papal usurpations, while peaceful retirement and
the amenity of the scene about him, rob controversy of
its acrimony, and allay the bitterness of censure by a
mixture of gentle pity.”</p>

<p class="noindent">there am I, and no longer in the sinfull and smoaking

on Tuesday, by very easy and speedy measures. We

it appears therefore with greater charms. It cannot

none to Art, it is merely a pretty shepherdess, who has
no graces but those of youth and simplicity; but my
dear Mrs. Boscawen may turn it into a paradise when
she pleases. When may I hope to see her here.... I
spent two days at Wickham last week; our good friends
had left the Archbishop of Canterbury only a few days
before I went to them. Mr. West seemed a good deal
affected by this return to Wickham, as to Mrs. West I
cannot so well judge, the cheerfulness she puts on is
<i>outré</i>.... Mr. West told me he would alter the room
where poor Dick dyed, for he did not like to go into it,
and then a soft tender shower fell down his cheeks, he
added he had lost much of his relish for Wickham; however
on the whole I found them better than I could have
expected!”</p>

<p>Directly after this, West was ordered to Tunbridge

passed a restless night, ‘Pox on this house, ’tis so

<p>To this letter she answers—</p>

<p>“Mr. Montagu has been studiously disposed ever

<div class="sidenote">MR. TORRIANO’S MARRIAGE</div>

<p>Mention is also made of Sam Torriano’s engagement
to Miss Scudamore, “who is said to have been handsome,
and it was on both sides a marriage of inclination.
He has delicacy enough to make him very happy or
very miserable, and restlessness enough to be very
uneasy in a state too insipid to allow of neither.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu might well make this remark on
Torriano’s marriage, as her friend Sir George Lyttelton’s<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
second matrimonial contract had by mutual consent
ended in a separation. In a former letter it will
be remembered that the haughty tone and unpleasant
manners of the lady were commented on. It was a case
of incompatibility of temper and thought, and a constant
imagination of bad health on her part. Lady Lyttelton
was a great friend of the Wests, and from a letter of
Lyttelton’s to West of this year it is evident that a little
coldness, which did not endure long, had sprung up
between West and his friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. WEST ILL</div>

<p>On July 8 and July 14 Sir George Lyttelton writes to
Archibald Bower a complete diary of his tour in North
Wales, accompanied by “Parson Durant and Mr. Payne.”
These letters Bower gave to Mrs. Montagu. They contain
many messages to the “Madonna,” but are, though
interesting, too long to insert here. At this period West
was at Tunbridge Wells, seeking health, but depressed
at the absence of Pitt, Lyttelton, Torriano, and, above
all, Mrs. Montagu; and from this letter it appears that
1750 was the year in which they first made friends at
Tunbridge. “Where are the happy seasons of 1750,
1751, 1752, and 1753?” he cries. “In the ‘Stone House’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>are Mr. Walpole and Lady Rachel, persons with whom
I have no concern.” The only people he now consorts
with are Mrs. Vesey, to whom he talks of Mrs. Montagu,
“we both love and honour you;” and Bishop
Gilbert and his daughter.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The Bishop of London
was expected. West laments “a difficulty of breathing,
accompanied with wheezing,” he thought asthma. “The
Doctors said Hysterical as only fit for <i>petticoats</i>!”
They prescribed assafœtida, valerian, and gum ammoniac.
He laments that Torriano “has done the irrevocable
deed, and is married on £500 per annum.”</p>

should live in Herefordshire, unless they are very fond
of cyder, for, in my opinion, London is the best place for
people of moderate circumstances. In the country people

<p>Hatchlands, near Guildford, belonged to Admiral
Boscawen. Writing thence to her husband Mrs.
Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We were received by Mrs. Boscawen with the most
joyful welcome, as we found her in great spirits on
account of the taking of the two French men of war.
Mr. Hoquart had been taken twice by Mr. Boscawen in
the last war, but did not surrender himself in this engagement
till 44 men were killed on board of his ship. Mr.
Boscawen writes that he lived at great expence, having
11 French officers at his table, whom he entertains with
magnificence, and there were 8 companies of soldiers on
board the <i>Alcide</i> and the <i>Lys</i>. I hope as Admiral Holborn
has joined Mr. Boscawen, we may soon hear of a more
considerable victory.... The Duke<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> declares himself
well pleased with Mr. Boscawen for his enterprise....
Mr. Boscawen was very much concern’d that the <i>Dauphin</i>,

escaped by means of a fog....”</p>

<p>“The Sheep Lees consists of a most beautiful down,
adorn’d with noblest beeches, commanding a rich gay

Our next visit was to Sir John Evelyn’s,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> you pass over
a high hill, finely planted, at the bottom of which lies the
good old seat, which is venerable and respectable, and

furnished and fitted up just as left them by their

tired of papier maché ceilings and gilt cornices, I was
glad to see an old hall such as ancient hospitality and
the plain virtues of our ancestors used to inhabit before
country gentlemen used to make fortunes in Parliament or
lose them at ‘White’s,’ hunted foxes, instead of Ministers,
and employ’d their finesse in setting partridges. The

<p>At the end of this letter mention is made of Travile,
a poor lady originally recommended by Lady Sandwich
as lady’s-maid to Mrs. Montagu. She was dying of consumption.
Three doctors had treated her, and now Dr.
Gregory put her on a diet of vegetable and asses’ milk.</p>

<p>Mr. Botham, writing from Albury, July 23, 1755,
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Captain Cunningham past through Guildford last
night express from the Governor of Hallifax in Nova
Scotia with advice that Col. Warburton of the land
forces had taken a fort at the back of Louisbourg called
Bouche, (by the bye the most material Fort belonging to
the French settlements), 500 men and 20 cannon; that
the Colonel had blocked up Louisbourg by land, and
Admiral Boscawen had done the same by sea; that the
town was very bare of provisions and must soon surrender,
and the sooner as the Colonel has turned in the
500 brethren to help to consume the faster; so that there
is great reason to suppose we shall soon be masters of
Louisbourg, and the Admiral of the 4 French men of war
blocked in the Harbour. We have taken papers of the
utmost consequence, which let us into the secret
schemes of the French, which were nothing less than a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>design of taking all our Plantations from us in America,
and Hallifax in the first place, was destined for destruction.”</p>
</div>

<p>West, writing on August 22 from Tunbridge Wells,
mentions that Lady Cobham and Harriet had left them
for Stoke, Mrs. Vesey was returning to Ireland, and the
Bishop of London had just left, “but while he was here
put into my hands some sheets of a third Volume of
Discourses now printing, which, as I had the chief hand
in prevailing upon him to publish, I received as a mark
of his regard for me.” The bishop was then in very bad
health. West was persuaded by the three doctors,
Duncan, Burgess, and Morley, to stay on at Tunbridge
Wells.</p>

<p>In a letter to Miss Anstey, who was with her friends,

Montagu says that Miss Pitt had left her to join her
brother, Mr. Pitt, and Lady Hester, at Sunninghill.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Mrs. Montagu accompanied her as far as Reading,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“where we dined in the garden of the inn, from whence
there is a fine gay prospect, and after dinner we
walked to see the ruins of the old Abbey, which was
most delightfully situated. The river winds about the

<p>She and Mr. Montagu were contemplating visiting
Mrs. Scott and Lady Bab Montagu at Bath Easton,
“but I do not propose to leave poor Travile as long as

The invalid seems to have been most religious, and one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>learns that by her request Mrs. Montagu nightly read
her the Service for the Sick.</p>

<p>On September 26, West informs Mrs. Montagu that
the Archbishop of Canterbury<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> had written to tell him
of the release of Governor Lyttelton, who, with his sister,
had been taken prisoners by the French in the <i>Blandford</i>,
which was conveying the Governor to his province,
South Carolina. This was William Henry, brother of
Sir George, and his sister Hester. The <i>Blandford</i> was
soon after this given up by the French. Mary Pitt,
writing to Mrs. Montagu, said that Governor Lyttelton’s
only loss was his wine and provisions on the <i>Blandford</i>,
he having sent most of his baggage by another ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. SCOTT’S DAILY LIFE</div>

<p>Travile becoming slightly better, Mrs. Montagu went
to Bath Easton to visit Mrs. Scott and Lady Bab Montagu.
In a letter to Dr. Gilbert West, October 16, after
her return to Sandleford, the following account is given
of the life led by the two lady friends:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My sister rises early, and as soon as she has read
prayers to their small family, she sits down to cut out
and prepare work for 12 poor girls, whose schooling
they pay for; to those whom she finds more than
ordinarily capable, she teaches writing and arithmetic
herself. The work these children are usually employed
in is making child-bed linen and clothes for poor people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>in the neighbourhood, which Lady Bab Montagu and she,
bestow as they see occasion. Very early on Sunday
morning these girls, with 12 little boys whom they also
send to school, come to my sister and repeat their
catechism, read some chapters, have the principal
articles of their religion explained to them, and then are
sent to the parish church. These good works are often
performed by the Methodist ladies in the heat of enthusiasm,
but thank God, my sister’s is a calm and
rational piety. Her conversation is lively and easy, and
she enters into all the reasonable pleasures of Society;
goes frequently to the plays, and sometimes to balls,
etc. They have a very pretty house at Bath for the
winter, and one at Bath Easton for the summer; their
houses are adorned by the ingenuity of the owners, but
as their income is small, they deny themselves unnecessary
expenses. My sister<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> seems very happy; it has
pleased God to lead her to truth, by the road of affliction;
but what draws the sting of death and triumphs
over the grave, cannot fail to heal the wounds of disappointment.
Lady Bab Montagu concurs with her in
all these things, and their convent, for by its regularity
it resembles one, is really a cheerful place.”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99" class="label">[99]</a> Mrs. Scott described their life in her novel, “<cite>Millenium Hall, by a

against a female author. Doubtless many of the histories are true in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISS POCOCKE</div>

<p>Writing to Sarah Scott of their safe return from Bath
Easton, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You would hardly imagine that the calm, meek Miss
Pococke<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> is as great a heroine as Thalestris, Boadicea,
or any of the termagant ladies in history. One Wednesday
night, she was awaken’d by a robber, who threw
himself across her bed and demanded her money; she
started up, seized him with one hand and rang her bell
with the other, and held him till the maid came into the
room, but at last he broke from her, and by the ill-management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
of her assistants made his escape. He is
our late Gardener’s son, whom you may remember a
boy in the gardens, his name Moses. He attempted to
break open our house two nights before, opened the
parlour sash, but could not force the shutters, which I
am glad he did not do, for any alarm to the poor sick
woman would have been a grievous thing.”</p>

governess, would keep a journal of all the instructions
the young lady has, and all her employments, and the
world might get a better treatise of education than any
yet extant. Mr. Pope says of Voiture ‘that trifles themselves
were elegant in him,’ a moderate praise to a man
who dealt only in trifles, but Mr. Pitt mixes the elegant
with the sublime.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPECTED INVASION</div>

<p>Great fears were entertained at this time of an

be gathering laurels, but as they are a deadly plant, I
could wish he was at his inglorious fireside. I am very
uneasy for the poor woman (Mrs. Boscawen) who is
still at Portsmouth, if any accident should happen to
him I should go post to her. It is thought that a
certain great, very great Dowager<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> has given some

<p>“The House of Commons sat till after 5 o’clock in the

in a new Play of Mr. Whitehead’s,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and Garrick and Mrs.
Cibber’s manner of speaking them examined.... I expected
to find the town full of the subsidies,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> they are
entirely forgot and never did the publick stand by more
quiet and contented. Mr. Fox and Mr. Pitt say a great
many very lively things to each other, which those who
are not personally attach’d to either hear with a great
deal of pleasure. Messrs. Legge, Pitt, and Grenville
are dismiss’d, but no one positively named to succeed
them; Lord Egmont, Lord Dupplin, Mr. Doddington,
and Charles Townsend are talk’d of. Sir George
Lyttelton is Chancellor of the Exchequer, which place
he was sollicited to accept. I wish the fatigue of it may
not impair his health, which is very delicate.”</p>

<p>“I imagine my dear sister would see a paragraph in

to her a farther account of my poor friend, Mr. West.
On the melancholy event I brought his sister to Hill
Street, where she is to stay a few days to recover in
some measure the consequences of her fatigue and the
shock her spirits have received. Mrs. West is with
Lady Cobham. She is sensible of her great loss, but
says she will behave under her affliction worthy the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
example of her excellent and worthy husband, and his
sentiments of resignation to the will of God, this resolution
join’d to natural good spirits and vivacity of mind,
supports her in a surprizing manner. I wish the good
man could have known she would have endured her
misfortune so well, apprehensions for her were all that
disturbed the peace, I might almost say the joy of his
deathbed. Miss West went thro’ the sad duties of
nursing with great fortitude, but, she is much affected
by her loss; the Admiral<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> his brother is in deep affliction,
Lady Langham<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> finds great resources in a very

his harping on small worries and domestic

<p>A heavy affliction now fell on the sisters; early in

the sea captain, had died at sea. This was acutely
felt by Sarah Scott, as he was her favourite brother,
probably from being nearest in age to her.</p>

<p>On June 24, in a letter to Mrs. Boscawen, this sad
subject is touched on—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know not how to reconcile myself to the loss of
one of the companions of my youth, the recollections of
one’s earliest season, the spring of life is usually pleasant
and gay, but whenever it offers itself to my mind, I cannot
help asking where are those who were my playfellows?
Faith should answer, with their Maker, reason, patience,
resignation, should take place, but there is a weakness
and stubbornness too in the human habit.... My poor
sister bears her loss patiently, but it touches her heart
very sorely.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADMIRAL BYNG</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu had been extremely unwell, and had
spent some weeks at Ealing Vicarage, lent to her by
Mr. Botham. Dr. Shaw ordered her to Tunbridge Wells.
Mrs. Boscawen had asked for her letters to Mr. West
to be returned; Mrs. West promises to do this. At the
end of the letter one reads this—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Montagu had just come in from the coffee-house.
Mr. Byng’s<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> expedition is unfortunate, not to say disgraceful,
instead of throwing succour into Minorca, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
was agreed in the Council of War that as there were
18,000 Frenchmen there, it would be these men; then
it was agitated whether they should engage with the
French, that was also carried in the negative; the third
question was whether they should go to take care of
Gibraltar, which was agreed on. Alas! Alas! the report
to-day is that Admiral West’s son is dead: one should
lament this if we had not greater reason to lament that
the English spirit is dead. Arthur was going to make

to the “Madonna’s” care, and they kept up a correspondence.

wild and dissolute life. She continues—</p>

<p>“The people at the Walks were all rejoicing poor
Admiral Byng was arrested at Portsmouth. I cannot

death must end his shameful life. Birth and Station

him the qualities necessary to become it.”</p>

Her mother was Jane Weller, of Kingsgate House,
Rolveden, Kent, of a good family. Mrs. Montagu did
not like the marriage, though she finally adopted their
second son, her nephew,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Matthew Robinson, and made
him take the name of Montagu. There never was any
cordiality between the sisters-in-law. Mrs. Morris
Robinson was a violent-tempered woman, and, despite
her good birth, very illiterate, which, to a person like
her sister-in-law, was extremely annoying, the more so
as Morris was one of her favourite brothers, and
extremely clever. As mentioned before, he belonged

it beginning to mortify, but he is now in a fair way of
recovery. He has shown a spirit suited to his profession,

his Father proposed to send him on board a frigate, with
Byng’s nephew, who was ordered to leave my brother’s
ship by his uncle, Admiral Byng, before the engagement
began, being, like my nephew, too young to be of use.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>My nephew remonstrated very strongly, ‘that Mr. Byng
was only a passenger, but he belonged to the ship he
was in, and therefore it would be such a disgrace that
he could never show his head again, should he quit it at
such a juncture:’ this joined to lamentation and importunity
prevailed; when he received his wound his Father
ran to pick him up and said, ‘I hope you are not much
hurt?’ ‘I believe I am killed, but pray don’t mind me,
Papa,’ answered the poor fellow.... Hagley is now
blessed with its master, who came on Monday last with
good health, looks and spirits. I was glad to see him
accompanied by Stillingfleet, so worthy a man deserves

<p>Mr. Pitt had taken such a fancy to Hayes since Mrs.
Montagu had lent him her house there, that he bought
it soon after her tenancy expired, as will be seen by
this passage in a letter of Bower’s to Mrs. Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Pitt is doing great things at Hayes, he has
bought the house, and the house hard by, and some
fields. He has built a wall towards the public road 13
feet high. He intends to pull down the old house, and
build another in the middle of the garden. His neighbour
Elly asks an exorbitant price for his house, £500.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mary Pitt, writing from Hayes on September 16,
mentions she is leaving to go to Howberry to the
Nedhams,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> in order to make room for Lady Hester’s
extra attendants, as Lady Hester was expecting her
confinement. Mrs. Montagu went for ten days to Bath
Easton to see Mrs. Scott. Lord Lyttelton, writing to
Mrs. Montagu on October 23, to enquire as to her health
and Mrs. Scott’s, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Fox<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> has determined to lay down the seals,
because he says he has not support or credit sufficient
to carry on the King’s business in the House of Commons,
and Mr. Pitt will not take them under the Duke of Newcastle.
What will be the consequence of all this I can’t
tell, my fears are great for the publick, for myself I have
none in any event: the worst that can happen to me is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>to remain in the office I am in under the Duke of Newcastle,
but I will remain for the same sense of honour
and duty upon which I came into it, if the King and his

them. How happy are Mr. Stillingfleet and Mr. Torriano
to enjoy the Madonna’s conversation, instead of

<div class="sidenote">DR. MESSENGER MONSEY</div>

<p>Further he alludes to Pitt being laid up with gout at
Hayes, “a legacy you left him,” alluding to her formerly
owning Pitt’s residence at that place. Then he mentions
Stillingfleet having been staying at Sandleford, and says,
“Monsey swears he will make out some story of you
and him before you are much older; you shall not keep
blew stockings at Sandleford for nothing.” This is the
first allusion to blue stockings, but that Stillingfleet’s
wearing blue stockings gave the name to the coterie
entirely, must be false. He was, however, a very learned
man, especially upon botany. In later letters allusion
is made to his having left off wearing blue stockings!
The coterie of friends probably was named thus after
the famous <i lang="fr">bas bleu</i> assemblies of Paris, held in the
<i lang="fr">salons</i> of Madame de Polignac in the Rue St. Honoré,
where the wearing of blue stockings was the rage: but
Dr. Monsey is mentioned for the first time here. Dr.
Messenger Monsey was the son of a clergyman; he
was born in 1698, so was fifty-eight years old at this
date. He was a doctor and surgeon, and became private
physician to the Earl of Godolphin, and afterwards
physician to Chelsea Hospital. He was most eccentric,
and, if his portrait at the Soane Museum was like
him, hideous in appearance; but he had a coarse rough-and-tumble
wit, and evidently was so droll in manner,
that he became a sort of pet buffoon of the Montagu
and Lyttelton circle. His letters are interminably long;
written in such small though neat writing, a magnifying
glass is required for careful perusal. He was at this
time a widower, with one married daughter, Charlotte,
whose husband, William Alexander, was elder brother
to the 1st Earl of Caledon. Mrs. Alexander had one
child, a daughter, Jemima, who married the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Edmund Rolfe, and was mother eventually of the 1st
Baron Cranworth. Monsey’s letters are so coarse one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
can hardly imagine the <i lang="fr">bas bleus</i> putting up with them.
Dr. Monsey begged Dr. Cruickshank, in case of his
dying away from his own doctor (Dr. Forster), to dissect
his body before the students, set up his skeleton for
instruction, and put his flesh in a box and throw it into
the Thames. He must either have been very swarthy,
or disliked soap and water, as Torriano, in allusion to
Monsey’s threat of inventing a story about Stillingfleet
and Mrs. Montagu, says, “Your fame, which was as fair
as Dian’s visage, will be soon black and begrim’d like
the Doctor’s own face!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMIN</div>

<p>During this year Mrs. Montagu had also formed an
acquaintance with an Armenian named Joseph Ameen,
or Emin. He was the son of a merchant, and born at
Hamadan, whither his father had been carried captive
by the Persians. His father at last escaped to Calcutta,
after being slave to Kouli Khan for many years. The
Persians, ever since 1604, under Shah Abbas, had
frequently made inroads into Armenia, captured the
majority of the inhabitants, and carried them away as
slaves into Persia. Emin grew up with a passionate
desire to free his country from oppression and the
yoke of unbelievers, for the Armenians were then, as
now, Christians. Emin says of his father in a letter to
his patron, the Earl of Northumberland<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My Father taught me like other Armenians only to
write and read in our own language, and to get Psalms
by heart to sing in Church, but he did not show me how
to handle arms to fight for that Church, as my Uncle did
who was killed at his Church door, nor anything to
kindle up my heart to understand great affairs.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMIN’S TROUBLES — EMIN’S FORTUNES</div>

<p>Burning to learn “the art of war” as practised by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>the British soldiers in India, and his father opposing
him, Emin determined on flight to England, and,
taking what money he possessed, he “kissed the feet
of Capt. Fox of the ship <i>Walpole</i> a hundred times to
let me work<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> my passage to Europe before he would
heed to me, but he did at last admit me, and I came to
England with much labour.” Arrived in England, he
entered Mr. Middleton’s Academy, and was first a scholar,
and then, when his money was exhausted, worked there
as a servant for his learning. His master becoming
bankrupt, Emin lost his all, and was reduced to the
streets. At last he obtained service with a Mr. Rogers,
a grocer, as porter. “In this time I carried burthens of
near 200 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> upon my back, and paid out of my wages
to learn geometry, complete my writing, and learn a
little French.” Overstraining himself, he could no longer
carry such heavy burthens, and was reduced to living
on 1½<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> a day, but a friend recommended him to a Mr.
Webster, an attorney in Cheapside, with whom he got
work for a time. His uncle sent £60 to Governor Davis
to take Emin home to India, but after a while, meeting
“by chance some gentlemen<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> who encouraged me and
lent me books, and advised me to kiss Colonel Dingley’s
hands and show him my business, he was a brave
soldier, took me by the hand, spoke to his own Sergeant,
an honest man, to teach me Manuel Exercise, and gave
me ‘Bland’s Military Discipline’ and promised to help
me learn gunnery and fortification.” Unfortunately
Colonel Dingley died, and Emin, in despair, and by the
advice of the gentlemen mentioned before, who appear
from the letters to have been a Calcutta lawyer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Edmund Burke, applied to the Earl of Northumberland
in a long letter, passages of which I have quoted. Emin
proposes that his lordship should apply to Governor
Davis for some of the money his uncle had sent to pay
for his passage back to India to enable him (Emin) to
join the “black Armenians in the mountains, as I heard
they had never been conquered,” to teach him the art of
war. The Earl of Northumberland at last—after Emin
waiting at his house often from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.!—took
notice of him, and sent his servant to fetch him to see
him, and on hearing his story, said, “Ameen, it is very
hard to live in this country without friends and without
money, almost four years, therefore the Lord is with
you, be contented, I will from this time provide and
furnish you with all necessaries,” and, said he, “I will
mediate to the son of our King, and after you have
learned the art of war, I will send you to your Father
and your Uncles: the noble lady<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> comforted me also
likewise.” Lord Northumberland introduced Emin to
Sir Charles Stanhope,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and he in turn to Lord Cathcart,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
who gave him great encouragement. Lord Northumberland
now introduced him to the Duke of Cumberland,
who henceforth took an interest in him. Emin applied
for military service in a long letter to Heraclius <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>,
King of Georgia and Armenia, who was anxious to
shake off the yoke of the Persians, but evidently the
reply was delayed, and the next we hear of him is that
he had been sent to Woolwich Academy, “to Mr.
Heaton’s on Church Hill,” to learn the “art of war.”
Having effected a reconciliation with his father, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>

this noble patron, the Earl of Northumberland—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On May 10, 1757, Emin writes from Woolwich to
implore Mrs. Montagu to use her influence with her
brother-in-law, Mr. Medows, who was intimate with the
Duke of Marlborough, to get him a commission in the
Royal Artillery, in order to enable him to join the British
army then fighting to defend Hanover, and assist the
King of Prussia against the inroads of the French.</p>

<p>This letter, speaking of Mrs. Montagu, addresses her
as “My Queen of Sheba,” and alludes to all “the noble
ladies of her circle,” and Dr. Monsey as “my honest,
dear Dr. Monsey.”</p>

<p>From a letter printed in my grandfather’s collection

The boxers and the bruisers Mr. Fox had on his side

the patients. The road is very fine, and made on purpose
for the drinkers. It is on the side of a hill, which
i am told is found by exact mensuration in some part to
be half a mile perpendicularly high, above a wide plain
that lies at the bottom. Towards the well the road
ascends considerably, so that i imagine the end of it is
not much less than halfway up to the top. A gentleman
in the neighbourhood has, at his own expense, made a
walk a little above the well; this walk runs on a level
for about 600 yards, winding with the breaks of the hill,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>and makes the noblest terrace i ever saw, the plain over
which you look being bounded by some fine hills, and
on it, lying on one side, Worcester, on the other Gloucester.
The hill is fed with sheep, here and there some
cattle graze, overhead I see my favourite bird, the Kite,
sailing, and all the while i tread on porphyry, the consciousness
of which, you may guess, adds not a little to
my satisfaction, when i consider that Princes are proud
to have a few pillars of this material.... The town lies
high on the side of the hill, and still on Porphyry. The
church, which stands a little lower, was a Priory....
Not far below the Church is a spring of the same nature
with that of Tunbridge.... I wish this place was
nearer to London, for it seems exactly adapted to do
you good.... There is a subscription going forward
for building a large lodging-house near the Well. At
present there is only one old house in the town, turned
entirely to that purpose, which contains about fifteen
persons, and one large room in it, where once a week
there is a sort of public breakfast and dinner. We have
had one public tea-drinking and card-playing in the
afternoon, by particular invitation; to-day it will begin
on another footing, and is to be weekly.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">TO “KILLUM.” — “KILLUM.”</div>

<p>Soon after the receipt of this letter, Mrs. Montagu
set out on a visit to Lady Bab Montagu and Mrs. Scott
at Bath Easton, and Mr. Montagu, on July 28, writes
to say he purposes driving to “Killum”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> to see his
friend Mr. Stevens.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> “Killum” was Culham Court,
Berks. George Stevens, a very eccentric character,
afterwards, in 1766, published an edition of Shakespeare,
and three years later some notes were incorporated in it
of Dr. Johnson’s. Mr. Montagu writes this description
of “Killum”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His house is a very good one, built about fifty
years ago, the rooms large and wainscoated with oak,
and three very good bedchambers with beds that at
some time cost a good deal of money, but are the worse
for time. He has been pulling down walls, and everything
lyes rough and without order or neatness, and to
finish the account of it, very much resembled its owner.
Its situation is what I think fine and much pleases me,
it is in a Valley which begins at the foot of that hill
which we see on Maidenhead Thickett, and goes as far
as Henley and further. The Thames runs quite through
it, is of good breadth, and with a great number of little
islands scatter’d here and there makes a most beautyfull
appearance. On the bank of this river, on a terrass the
house is built, it is of considerable extent, and if adorn’d
with plantations and buildings would be very pretty
and pleasant, but to do this may require a greater
expense than may be convenient, so that all he at present
thinks of doing is the improving the lawn....
You might blame me if I omitted giving you some
account of one of a kind very uncommon. I mean Mr.
Hart’s<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Chinese house. This stands in a beech wood
of Mr. Stevens about half a mile from him. Consists
of a suite of rooms pav’d with pantyles and hung with
paper, and on the outside is embellish’d with very costly
decoration of the Chinese manner. Mr. Stevens says
the cost has been about two thousand pounds, but I
don’t believe three would pay for it. It seems to me
no more than a whim, and so much money flung away.
It stands very high, and has a more extensive view than
Mr. Stevens’. It might be agreeable to entertain a
company there in the finest and warmest weather, but
one cannot think of it as an habitation without shuddering.
At present no use is made of it; three servants
are kept there who have no other business than to look
after the house, keep the wood walks in order, and
breed pheasants; in about 15 years the lease expires,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>and then it comes to Mr. Stevens.” Mr. Montagu says,
“I have some other thoughts of taking another ramble
about the middle of the week to Winchester, and
perhaps Southampton.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I look upon Mr. Stevens as a man who has disfranchised
himself from all slavery to custom and fashion,
and who as seldom brushes up or new trims his modes
of living as his coat, but wears both as long as they fit
him, in spite of what fops and taylors may say. I hope
he will come to Sandleford, for he has parts enough to
make his singularities amusing. I dare say he was very
happy in the visit you made him, both for the pleasure
of your conversation and from a little vanity, for tho’
the modes of singularity may give a man an air of designing
to live alone and of contemplation, in the world,
I believe one may venture to say, none are more desirous
of regard and notice than those who affect to retire and
be singular; they rather design their peculiarities for a
badge of distinction than a line of separation between
them and Society; and a man in low life may go ungarter’d
or cross-garter’d, who in another station would
have been ambitious of a blue garter, and their installment
into a particular character is a matter of great wit....
We had a report that the Duke had killed 3000
French, but he is well off if he can keep on the defensive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
I had a letter from Mr. Emin that the Duke of Cumberland
received him in the most gracious manner, and he

<p class="greet2">“I believe your ladyships have been in a long
expectation to hear from this part of the world, more
especially of the battle which began on the 23rd of
July. In the morning we were ordered out with 25
horses and 200 foot irregulars to secure a post, where
we found 300 husars and 700 foot soldiers, upon which
we began immediately to fire, and they retreated very
soon; and in the afternoon his highness, hearing that
the French were advancing with their whole army,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>ordered that the part of his army were to advance
also, but it was very unlucky for us that our infantry
was too late; and before they could come up, the enemy
begun from some distance to fire upon us with their
cannon, with no manner of execution. His Royal Highness
thought proper to return to his camp in Aferden.
The next day, the enemy, still advancing from their camp
at Halla all along the river Vizer,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and were retreating
untill we halted upon a high hill with full of trees, and
they on another; were the firing of cannon began again
on both sides, and lasted till evening. Our situation not
being so well as we could wish, we still retreated till we
come to Hamelin,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> there we posted the right of our army,
and our left at Onsburg, and unfortunate Hastenbek<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
between us and the enemy, which was soon burnt down.
The 25th, about four in the morning, the enemy began
to advance with their musicks and drums, making a very
great noise, more like Indians than Europeans, and was
soon silenced; as a few of our balls, and cannonading
begun of both sides briskly. At that time your slave
was upon a hill with no more than 200 irregulars, commanded
by my friend, Major Freydag, a man of good
conduct and judgment, where we could see the two
armies very plain. It was a place had it not been so
dangerous as the cannon balls were flying like so many
flies over our heads, I would wish my noble friend ladies
who are my patronesses and who are so fond of Heros
and hearing of battles, to have seen it, which would
really have been worth their while; then I would have
wished again that the heavenly chariots where descended
from the gods above, to have transported them to their
native and blessed Island, peradventure they should have
been in the greatest of dangers, for wee saw about eleven
of the clock the enemy with no less than six thousand of
Horses and Foot comming up to us of all sides with a
great fury, except a little grass that led us down to our
army, but this bravery of theirs was greatly owing to an
information which they had of us a day before. Knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
that we were no more than two hundred men, or else
they woud not be so furious in their attack, for they are
vastly like the black Indians, fire at a great distance and
run away. However, we stood almost half an hour, our
men ralyed three times and killed no less than 300 of
them; for our men are brought up from their infantry
(<i>sic!</i>) as huntsmen, they never miss their mark. I have
seen them shoot at 300 yards’ distance; they are like the
mountiniers of Armenia and Dagastun, the French husars
run away as soon as they see us. You see, my noble
ladies, what great advantage it is to a Nation who has
the liberty not only to kill the partridges but to kill as
many deers and other animals as they please. The loss
of ours was but 20 and 6 wounded, we could not support
any longer and where obliged to retreat, and join the
army, and about 2 a-clock in the afternoon, the enemy
retreated with the loss of eleven cannon, and had taken
some of ours, but we retaken them again, but the battle
continued still and lasted from 4 in the morning to 6 in
the afternoon, the loss of their side was about 3000 and
about 1200 of ours, we don’t look upon this as a battle
in Persia, but as a scarmish (<i>sic!</i>). The inventor of gunpowder
tho’ he is cursed by many ignorant people but
his invention has been a very great service towards
preservation of Mankind, gunpowder is a thing which
makes a great noise like lightning and thunder keep
mankind distant with an awe. ‘The thought of gunpowder,’
says the great Marshal de Saxe, ‘is more than
the danger itself.’ I woud wish to have no more than
1500 Persian Horse if it is not too bold and your humble
servant the teacher of them, we could soon show the
French that the effect of symiters (<i>sic</i>) would be greater
than that of gunpowder tho’ their number of what we
hear is one hundred fifty thousand men and ours are
you very well know. At present we are upon marches
and countermarches.”</p>

<p>At the end of the letter he says he has received

India, as he will not be a “begar” any longer on his

<p>This battle was that of Hastenbeck. The Duke of
Cumberland had placed the archives and valuable effects
from Hanover in the town of Stadt, and from Stadt came
a letter from Emin to Dr. Monsey, on September 13, just
after the famous Convention of Kloster-Seven had, by
the intervention of the King of Denmark, been signed,
and peace arranged. In reply to Dr. Monsey’s inquiry
about the Duke of Cumberland’s health, Emin says,
“You are desirous to know how my royal master is.
Mr. Andrews (<i>valet</i>), with his compts. to you, says
his Royal highness’s leg is quite well, so you may
be easy.”</p>

<p>To return to Mrs. Montagu, staying at Bath Easton,
on August 1, writing to her husband, she expresses
herself uneasy, as Admiral Boscawen was recalled from
the fleet, for what he knew not. “Mr. Boscawen will
be busy enquiring the cause of his being recalled, he
has merit and a powerful family, and I hope his ennemies
cannot oppress tho’ they may oppose him. Do not
mention this affair.”</p>

<p>In July Mrs. Morris Robinson had presented her
husband with a son and heir, who was christened
Morris, after his father, and became eventually 3rd

Severn of forty miles is one of the most inconsiderable

she governed her husband to such a degree that he was
almost a cypher and a prisoner in his own house, she
being, though an indifferent wife, a most brilliant spirited
woman. After her lord’s death in 1729, she lived in

Mrs. Montagu in 1739, respecting her son John, 4th Earl
of Sandwich (“Jemmy Twitcher”). He was then eleven
years old, and his mother sent him to sea. Probably he
was even then very unruly, but he could not bear the
sea, and through Mr. Montagu she applied to their
common connection, John, Duke of Montagu, to get
him a commission in the Army, buying it “as an
ensign in a marching regiment.” The duke’s reply to
this is singularly indifferent in expression, and his

To compass this he risqued his life, and endured the

<p>On September 15 Mrs. Montagu wrote a long letter

to the humorous affection for her which Dr. Monsey
had developed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You must know Sir, Dr. Monsey is fallen desperately
in love with me, and I am most passionately in
love with him, the darts on both sides have not been the
porcupine’s, but the grey goose quill. We have said so
many tender things to each other by the post, that at last
we thought it would be better to sigh in soft dialogue
than by letter. We agreed to meet, and the rather, as
all the lovers we had read of (and being in love with
each other only <i lang="fr">du coté de l’esprit</i>, you may suppose
we woo by book) had always complained of absence as
the most dreadful thing imaginable. He said, nay he
swore, he would come to Sandleford, and twice had
named the day, but each time his grand-daughter fell
sick, and I know not whether he will keep the third
appointment, which is for next Monday. These disappointments
have made me resolve, and I really believe
it will not be difficult to keep the resolution, never again
to fall in love with a man who is a grandfather. In all
other respects the Doctor is a perfect Pastor Fido, and I
believe when we get to Elysium, all the lovers who
wander in the Myrtle Groves there will throw their
garlands at our feet.”</p>

received a commission rather unexpectedly, owing to
the failure of the Hawke and Mordaunt expedition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am a little uneasy lest the surprize should have

which I hope his country will reap from his arms, but
think me not ignoble if I own, glory is but a bright
moonshine when compared to your welfare, and think
me not below the standard of true patriotism, if I confess,
it is for the sake of such as you, my country is a
name so dear. I know you are too reasonable to wish
Mr. Boscawen might avoid the hazards of his profession.

same day, the accidents of life are more than the chances
of war. Be not afraid, but commit it all to the great
and wise Disposer of all events; a firm hope and cheerful
reliance on Providence I do believe to be the best
means to bring about what we wish, and that such confidence
does it far better than all our anxious foresight,
our provident schemes and measuring of security. I
remember with sorrow and shame, I trusted much to a
continual watching of my son,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> I would not have committed
him to a sea voyage, or for the world in a town
besieged, I forgot at Whose will the waves are still, and
Who breaketh the bow and knappeth the spear asunder.
What was the reward of this confidence of my own care
and diffidence of His who only could protect him?
Why, such as it deserved, I lost my beloved object, and
with him my hopes, my joys, and my health, and I lost
him too, not by those things I had feared for him, but by
the pain of a tooth. Pray God keep you from my offence
and the punishment of it. I do not mean that you
should be void of anxiety in times of hazard, but offer
them to God every night and sleep in peace, the same
every morning, and rise with confidence.... I am
much pleased with his Majesty’s confidence in Mr.
Boscawen....</p>

<p>“The Duke,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> it seems, is gone to plant cabbages; as

<p>A letter from Mrs. Donnellan throws a light on the
Mordaunt affair.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All I can gather of this most shameful affair is that
there will be no more known till there is a publick
enquiry,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and then if the scheme is proved by the
General Officers to have been impracticable, those who
sent them on it must suffer, but if it is found that they
might have made more of it, I suppose they will....
It will be defered (the enquiry, I mean) till the sitting
of parliament. Sir J. Mordaunt and Admiral Hawke
have both been to Court, the Admiral was received
graciously, the other taken no notice of, ’tis said he
stooped to kiss the royal hand, but it was pulled back
from him; wou’d it not have been more kingly to have
forbidden his coming? ’Tis said soon after some of the
troops were in the boats in order to land; there was a
council of war called, and when Hawke thought they
were landed, they were ordered on board again; ’tis
certain there were 5 or 6 days spent on councils of
war, and then Hawke, who was not concerned in them,
desired them to come to some resolution, for he wou’d
either land them or return home. Colonel Conway, I
hear, showed the most spirit, and that our commen men
showed no unwillingness to action.... The Duke
came thro’ the city on Thursday at four in the afternoon.
I saw some who saw him, there was no sort of
notice taken of him; I think he was well off. I suppose
you have seen the King of Prussia’s letter to our King,
’tis denyed but believed to be genuine. I think your
remarks on the correspondence between the King of
Prussia and Voltair (<i>sic</i>) very just; however, I forgive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>him some levity when conversed with a wit, and part

<p>Mr. Montagu, writing from Sandleford on November
6, to his wife, mentions Hawke being sent out again
with Boscawen, “was a clear proof that they had nothing
to impute to him which was faulty.” He was busy
planting at Sandleford, and said he must get chestnuts
and acorns when he came to London, as the last sown
had been rotten, “according to Millar the way of trying
them is somewhat like that formerly us’d in the case

<div class="sidenote">MRS. MONTAGU’S ILLNESS</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu, with the advice of Dr. Shaw and Dr.
Monsey, gradually recovered her health. Wormwood
draughts were prescribed; her illness appears to have
been a nervous fever, with weakness and loss of appetite.
Of Dr. Monsey she says, “He has given me as much
attendance as if I was a Princess of the blood, tho’ I
have never given him a fee.” Dr. Shaw had been called
off to the Duchess of Newcastle at Claremont, who was
suffering in the same way. Great discussion is given
as to giving of the “bark” without danger, and when to
do so. “Dr. Shaw has had six guineas of me, I shall
give him no more, I had difficulty to make him accept
the last, but he attended me at first twice a day.” The
Mordaunt affair is alluded to in each letter. In one
occurs the following—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord Chesterfield in a letter from Bath to Lady
Allen writes thus: ‘Your ladyship may believe all the
circles here think they have a right to form a court-martial
to sit on Sir J. M. For my part I wait for information.
I can never believe he wants courage or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>

impracticable and they must answer who sent him.’”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">ROSBACH</div>

<p>On November 7, Mr. Montagu writes to announce
his intention of joining his wife, and adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I see by the <cite><i>Gazette</i></cite> that the King of Prussia has
obtained a great victory over the combined army under
Prince Soubise. This is an unexpected event, and must
give a turn to his affairs. One thing seems to be collected
from it, that this enterprising courageous Prince
has not made peace nor flung himself into the arms of
France as we were given to believe.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the Battle of Rosbach in Saxony, won
against the Austrians and French by Frederick the
Great of Prussia on November 5, 1757. The year’s
correspondence ends with a letter to Emin of Lady
A. Sophia Egerton, enclosing a letter of recommendation
of him to her uncle, Mr. Bentinck, then in diplomatic

Sandleford. In it she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall enclose an <cite><i>Advertizer</i></cite> in which you will
find a curious article from Warsaw. It astonished all
Europe to find the King of Prussia had got copies of the
plans of the Imperial Court and Dresden, the means by
which he obtained them are now discover’d. To this
contrivance his Prussian Majesty and his Country owe
their present being, but one cannot envy the state of a
King if it is necessary to take such means for preservation
as would startle a vulgar man of Honour. To get
false keys to cabinets is but a poor low trick, and it is
very strange to see a hero guilty of burglary, but as
Mr. Pope observes, ‘the story of the great is generally
a tale that blends their glory with their shame.’ Mr.
Stanhope call’d on me as I was writing, and I am to
dine with my brother Morris, so must abridge my letter.
I can’t hear what pass’d in the House of Lords yesterday
in Delany’s trial.... I was at the Oratorio last
night, where I heard the Dublin man-of-war was sent to
Mr. Boscawen to supply the loss of the <i>Invincible</i>. I
am to be at Lady Hillsborough’s assembly to-night.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Delany trial had lasted for nearly ten years.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>It was on account of Dr. Delany, in inadvertence, having
burnt a paper of importance belonging to his first wife.
Sometimes it appeared to be at an end, but it was as
often renewed. At last, on March 5, Lord Mansfield,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
after an hour and a half’s speech, decided in favour of
Delany. The cost of the suit exceeded the disputed
sum, but the relief to the good dean and his wife on its
decision balanced everything.</p>

occurences, they have been so boisterously carried I
need not change the tone of my narrative; the Judges,
the Lord Keeper, the Chief Justice, and the late Lord
Chancellor gave their opinions against the Habeas
Corpus bill.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Lord Temple, much in wrath, insulted
the Judges in some of his questions; Lord Lyttelton
warmly and sharply reproved him upon which words
rose high, the House of Lords interfered. The last day
of this bill, Lord Mansfield and Lord Hardwicke<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> spoke
so full to the matter, even Tory Lords, and these most
violent in their wishes for it, declared they were convinced
the new bill was dangerous to liberty in many
respects, in many absurd; so that had there been a
division there would not have been four votes for it, but
Mr. Pitt’s Party discreetly avoided a division. This
affair has not set the legislative wisdom of the House of
Commons in a very high light, but the great Mr. Beckford,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
whom no argument can convince, no defeat make
ashamed, nor mistake make diffident, did on the motion
for a vote of credit stand up in the House of Commons
and say he would not oppose that measure, as he had
an opinion of the two Commoners in the administration,
but in the Peers that composed it, he had no confidence,
and ran in foul abuse of them and then ended with a
severe censure of the House of Lords in general. Lord
Royston<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> answered him that this was unparliamentary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
where personal, and indecent in regard to the House of
Peers in general, to which Mr. Pitt answered with great
heat that he was sorry to hear such language from a
gentleman who was to be a Peer; he set forth the great
importance and dignity of Mr. Beckford personally, and
above all the dignity and importance of an alderman,
concluding it was a title he should be more proud of
than that of a Peer. This speech has enraged the Lords,
offended the Commons, and the City ungratefully say
was too gross. Those who wish well to this country,
and consequently to a union of parties at this juncture,
are sorry for these heats; it is well if they do not unsolder
the Union.... I began Islington Waters to-day....

<div class="sidenote">JOHN ROGERS — ROGERS’ WILL</div>

<p>Mention has been made of Mr. John Rogers, first
cousin on his mother’s side to Mr. Montagu, also of Mr.
Montagu becoming his trustee in 1746, when he was
pronounced a lunatic. At first it seems that he
suffered from epileptic fits, which increased to lunacy,
but of a mild order. On June 23 Mr. Edward Steuart
wrote to say Mr. Rogers was seriously ill, and his
death expected hourly; he was being attended by Dr.
Askew, then a famous north-country doctor, and several
surgeons, for a mortification in his leg.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> On the 24th he
expired, in his seventy-fourth year, at his house in Pilgrim
Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne. Mr. Montagu was his
principal heir. Mrs. Montagu, in a letter respecting the
estate of East Denton, etc., wrote in later days, “Mr. M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
has half the estate by descent, a share by testamentary
disposition, and a part by purchase.” Mr. Rogers’
lunacy seems to have been made worse by the death
of his wife, Anne Delaval, daughter of Sir John Delaval,
whom he married in 1713, and who died in 1722–23.
His will was made in 1711, and a codicil added 1715,
in which he left his property, after the death of his
mother, Mrs. Elizabeth Rogers, to his wife, and failing
issue by her, to the Montagus and Creaghs, all first
cousins. Mary Creagh had married Dominick Archdeacon,
and her sister Margaret, Anthony Isaacson; Mr.
Montagu’s two brothers, Crewe and John, being dead,
the only other heir was Jemima, Mrs. Medows, afterwards
Lady Medows. The estates were very large;
besides Denton, with its coal-mines, houses in Newcastle,
and in Bramston, Lamesley, Harburn, Parkhead, and
Jarrow, in the county of Durham; lands at Hindley,
Sugley, Throckley, Newbiggin, Scotswood, etc., etc.;
collieries and saltpans in Cullercoats, Monkseaton,
Whitley, and Hartley, etc., etc. Mrs. Montagu was
at Ealing with the Bothams when the express came.
She writes to her husband, “It gives me pleasure to
think I shall see you with unblemished integrity and
unsoiled with unjust gain, enjoying that affluence many
purchase with the loss of honesty and honour.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELIZABETH CARTER — MRS. MONTAGU’S LETTER</div>

<p>The next letter is the first I possess to Elizabeth
Carter, whose learned translation of Epictetus was
first printed in April of 1758. Miss Carter, or <i>Mrs.</i>
Carter (as courtesy termed her), was the daughter of a
clergyman, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Nicholas Carter, D.D., Perpetual
Curate of Deal, Kent, where he resided; he had been
twice married, and Elizabeth was his child by his first
marriage. To his children by both marriages Mr. Carter
gave an excellent education, and at an early age Elizabeth
studied Latin, Greek, and eventually Hebrew. She was
a proficient in French, and taught herself Italian, Spanish,
and German; later in life Portuguese and Arabic were
added. Her application to study produced severe headaches,
principally brought on by drinking green tea and
taking snuff to keep herself awake. It appears that
Mrs. Montagu had met her in 1757, but Mrs. Carter had
rather avoided such a brilliant acquaintance, being herself
of a most humble and unambitious character, despite
her learning. From the following portions of Mrs.
Montagu’s letter we learn that Miss Carter had been
paying her a visit:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Hill Street, July 6, 1758.<br>
</p>

<p>“What must my dear Miss Carter think of the signs
of brutal insensibility which I have given in not answering
her obliging letter? As my heart has had no share
in the omission, I have no apologies to make for it; no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
day has passed since you left us in which I have not
thought of you with esteem and affection; I look upon
my introduction to your acquaintance as one of the
luckiest incidents of my life, if I can contrive to improve
it into friendship; this is, and has been the state of my
mind and I am proud of it: as to my conduct in the
commencement of our correspondence, I am ashamed of
it. I was ill when I received your polite and agreeable
letter. I have ever since been drinking Islington waters,
from which I receive some benefit, but with this inconvenience,
that I am unable to write till late at night, and
even then not without headache. The death of a relation
of Mr. Montagu’s in the North, which happened about a
fortnight ago, with a large accession of fortune, has
brought me the usual accompaniment of riches, a great
deal of business, a great deal of hurry, and a great many
ceremonious engagements. The ordering funeral ceremonies,
putting a large family in mourning, preparing for
a journey of 280 miles, and receiving and paying visits
on this event, has made me the most busy miserable
creature in the world. As the gentleman from whom
Mr. Montagu inherits had been mad above 40 years and
almost bed-ridden the last ten, I had always designed to
be rather pleased and happy when he resigned his unhappy
being and his good estate. I thought in fortune’s
as in folly’s cup, still laughed the bubble joy; but though
this is a bumper, there is not a drop of joy in it, nor so
much as the froth of a little merriment. As soon as I
rise in the morning, my housekeeper with a face full of
care, comes to know what must be packed up for Newcastle;
to her succeeds the Butler, who wants to know
what wine, etc., is to be sent down; to them succeed
men of business and money transactions; then the post
brings twenty letters, which must be considered and
some answered. In about a week we shall set out for
the North, where I am to pass about three months in
the delectable conversation of Stewards and managers
of coal mines, and this by courtesy is called good fortune,
and I am congratulated upon it by every one I meet;
while in truth, like a poor Harlequin in the play, I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>acting a silly part <i lang="fr">dans l’embarras des richesses</i>. I would
not have troubled you with this detail, but as part of my
defence for not having written to you. I can perfectly
understand why you were afraid of me last year, and
I will tell you, for you won’t tell me; perhaps you have
not told yourself. You had heard I set up as a wit,
and people of real merit and sense hate to converse
with witlings, as rich merchant-ships dread to engage
privateers, they may receive damage and can get nothing
but dry blows. I am happy you have found out I am
not to be feared; I am afraid I must improve myself
much before you will find I am to be loved. If you will
give affection for affection <i lang="fr">tout simple</i> I shall get it from
you....”</p>
</div>

<p>Mention is made of Emin’s joining the King of
Prussia, so he was known to Mrs. Carter, probably
through Lord Lyttelton.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have the pleasure of hearing infinite commendations
of Epictetus every day; from such as are worthy
I taste a particular pleasure; from the multitude I take
it in the gross, as it makes the sum of universal fame.
Some praises I heard a few days ago at the Bishop of
London’s I put in the first class.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD LYTTELTON TO DR. MONSEY</div>

<p>A most amusing letter from Lord Lyttelton to Dr.
Monsey of July 24 now occurs, in which he returns a
letter of Mrs. Montagu’s to the doctor, and summons
him to a duel of words in her praise on Hagley turf.
He teases Dr. Monsey with the idea of her going north,
and advises him “to quit Lord Godolphin to follow
love, follow him over the Cheviot Hills and down to
the coal-pits at Newcastle.” After a great deal of chaff
it ends, “Your most affectionate, humble Servant,—<span class="smcap">Lyttelton</span>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. MONTAGU’S SYMPTOMS</div>

<p>This frightened Monsey, so on July 30 he writes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
from St. James’s and gives her strings of advice as to
her health.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know the generality of Physicians will be cautious
of blooding you, as being what is called nervous; I know
nothing of nerves in the usual sense of the word, if indeed
it has any precise meaning at all, it is used by the
wise to quiet fools, and by fools to cover ignorance.”
Then he adds in high fever she may be blooded, “5, 6 or 7
ounces, and if you flag a blister! will set matters to right.
I say nothing of vomits, you can’t bear ’em, but you will
gentle purging, your lemon mixture and contrayserva
with a little saffron, be cautious of hot medicines, but
do not wholly throw them away, as to spasms and
cramps they are such Proteuses, one does not know
how to catch or hold them, Valerian and Castor are in
such reputation for vanquishing those Hussars.... Assafœtida
you can’t bear, I wish you cou’d ... if feverish
3 spoonfuls of a decoction of the bark by boyling one
ounce and half in a quart of water to a pint, and if your
stomach flags put in from 5 to 10 drops of Elixir of
Vitriol, so arm’d a common cold will not have courage
to attack you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Finally he consigns her to a Dr. Ramsay’s care, should
she require a physician!</p>

<p>On August 1 Mrs. Boscawen wrote from Hatchlands
a long letter describing a visit to London. Her letters
are sprightly, but too much larded with French words
and phrases; the end is interesting—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i lang="fr">Enfin</i> we left this dear odious London at 4 in the
afternoon, <i lang="fr">chemin faisant</i> I thought within myself, what
if I should meet an express from America, and sure
enough upon Cobham Common I met a post-chaise containing
an officer, on him I star’d attentively, he star’d
again; then he cry’d ‘Stop,’ I echoed ‘Stop,’ <i lang="fr">enfin</i> I heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
him ask ‘is Admiral Boscawen’s<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> lady in that coach?’
I make quick reply in the affirmative, and soon he produced
himself at my coach window, and told me he was
express sent by the Governor of Nova Scotia with news
of our troops having taken the Forts of Beau Sejour and
Chignecto, that he attended Admiral Boscawen for his
orders twenty-three days ago, and left him in perfect
health; he added that Admiral Boscawen had saved
North America, where all our Colonies were in the
utmost danger, as well as consternation till he came.
Papers having been found which showed the French
had a design to destroy Halifax, where the people
imagin’d the French wou’d let in the Indians to massacre
them.... He added, ‘Mr. Boscawen had taken, or as
the phrase there is <em>detain’d</em>, six French merchant ships,
and had blocaded Louisbourg.’”</p>
</div>

<p>She adds that her letters from her husband were with
Mr. Cunninghame (the Officer), addressed to Mr. Cleveland,
so she let them go, and sent on her black servant
“Tom” next day to fetch them, and was going to Portsmouth
to meet the Admiral, who thought he should
soon be back.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE WAY NORTHWARDS</div>

<p>To return to the Montagus, they set out on August 1
for the North, and the first letter is from her to Lord

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am now about 25 miles short of Newcastle, having
travelled above 250 miles since last Tuesday, and am
better to-night than I was when I left London, so I will
no longer endure that Dr. Monsey shall call me flimsy
animal, puny insect, and such opprobrious names. I
have had a surfeit of being in a post-chaise, that I have
not made many excursions to see the fine places that
lay in the road. In my way to Nottingham I went to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Sir Robert Clifton’s,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> which appears to me for beauty

<div class="sidenote">MARY WEST</div>

<p>To this Lord Lyttelton writes from Hagley on
August 17, to say how glad he is she bore the journey
so well, and the book entertained her. He had been
drinking the waters at Sunning Hill, Berks, and found
benefit. In the end of a long letter he writes, “Miss
West and Captain<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Hood will be as happy next
Monday as mutual love can make them.” Miss West
was Gilbert West’s sister, and her future husband,
Captain Hood, became afterwards first Viscount Bridport.
Mary West lived till 1786, but had no children.
Lord Lyttelton alludes to her not being very young
and “having no time to lose.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tom and I came this afternoon to this sweet abode

owned to me that the cascades and rills never murmured
so sweetly before.... The Dean<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> came to Hagley just

return again to daylight? Upon my word I am afraid
you are in some danger, as the Habeas Corpus Bill was
thrown out; for all the women of the upper world will
make interest with the Judges to let you stay there. Yet I

It is dated, “Carville, ye 22nd day of August.” Carville

letter I give—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I desired Dr. Monsey to acquaint you with the
death of Mr. Rogers. Many letters were to be written
in order to procure him most pompous funeral obsequies,
according to the fashion of Northumberland, as he was
allied to the people of the first rank in the county, and
they were all to be at the funeral.... The 7th of
August at noon we got to Durham, and there began
hurrys and ceremonies that have continued to this day,
and I know not when I shall see a quiet hour. At
Durham we were met by a great number of Mr. Rogers’
relations, and the Receivers and Agents of his estate,
who attended in great form till we got to Newcastle,
where we were to stay two or three days, with a relation
of Mr. Montagu’s till our house was aired. We had not
been an hour at Newcastle before we had the compliments
of the principal persons of the Corporation and
in the town. The next morning visits began.... We
had fifteen people to dine here on Sunday, a family
yesterday, people about business to-day, and three
families to dine here to-morrow; in the morning I am
up to the elbows in dusty parchments and accounts,
after dinner as busy as an hostess of an Inn attending
her guests, at night as sick as an invalid in Hospital,
and these are the woes of wealth, and I am not <i lang="fr">une

having been uninhabited many years, was not fit for our
reception, his house<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> in Newcastle was not agreeably
situated for the summer, so we hired a house on the
banks of the Tyne for the occasion. It is a very pretty
house, extreamly well furnished and most agreeably
situated, ships and other vessels from Newcastle are
sailing by every hour. The river here is broad and of a
good colour, and we have a fine reach of it: we have a
very good turnpike road to the sea-side, where I should
pass a great deal of my time if it was not all engross’d
by company, but we are in the midst of the largest
neighbourhood I ever saw, and some of these gentlemen
by means of coal mines have immense fortunes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEWCASTLE</div>

<p>In a letter to her sister, Mrs. Scott, Newcastle is
described.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The town of Newcastle is horrible, like the ways of
thrift it is narrow, dark and dirty, some of the streets so
steep one is forced to put a dragchain on the wheels:
the night I came I thought I was going to the center.
The streets are some of them so narrow, that if the
tallow chandler ostentatiously hangs forth his candles,
you have a chance to sweep them into your lap as you
drive by, and I do not know how it has happened that I
have not yet caught a coach full of red herrings, for we
scrape the Citty wall on which they hang in great abundance.
There are some wide streets and good houses.
Sir Walter Blackett’s seems a noble habitation.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mention is made of the Claverings, Bowes, and Lord
Ravensworth calling.</p>

<p>In a letter of August 25 to Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Montagu
tells her, that <i>en route</i> to Newcastle, she had visited “Althorpe,
the seat of Mr. Spencer, worthy of regard only
on account of a very fine collection of pictures. The
park is planted in a dull uniformity, the ground flatt
(<i>sic</i>), little prospect, has not the advantage of a river or
lake.” After repeating the details of her journey, she
adds that Denton Hall</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“had not been inhabited for 30 years, the poor
gentleman having long been a lunatick, so I imagined
the rats and ghosts<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> were in such full possession, it
would require time to eject them, and I am now placed

We have a very good land as well as water prospect.

<div class="sidenote">ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD</div>

<p>On August 27 Mrs. S. Montagu wrote to young Tom
Lyttelton a long letter describing the country round
Newcastle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After dinner I ferried over the river Wear to
Sunderland, a good sea-port town. They are making a
new pier there, which is done at the expense of the coal-owners,
who have mines near the Wear. I got a very
pleasant walk on the sea-shore; several ships were
sailing out of the harbour fraught only with the comforts
and conveniences of life, they carry out coal and salt and
bring home money. I question whether those who carry
out death and bring home glory are concerned in so
good merchandize, though they account their occupation
more honourable. On Thursday I went to see Lumley
Castle; it is a noble habitation, but so modernized by
sash windows and other fashionable ornaments, I admired
it only as a good house. There are many family
pictures in the Hall, a succession of 16 Lumleys, all
martially accoutred, the Lumley arms on their shields,
their figure and attitudes make them look like scaramouches.
They hang so high I could not read the inscriptions,
but I imagine it is intended one should suppose
each picture was taken from life; but from the
dress and character, I am sure they have been done by
one hand from the genealogical tree. There are many
old pictures in the house, and many fair testimonies of
the ancient nobility of the family, but I cannot pass them
sixteen<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> generations. There are large plantations of
firs at Lumley Castle, a large park behind the Castle, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the front a good prospect, and the river Wear at a due
distance.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu was connected with the Lumleys, her
cousin, Mrs. Laurence Sterne, being the daughter of the
Rev. Robert Lumley, of Lumley Castle. At the end of
the letter she complains of the tediousness of the post—three
weeks before she had any letters from her
friends!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CAPTURE OF LOUISBURG</div>

<p>This accounts for the news of the taking of Louisburg
on July 27, under Admiral Boscawen, General Amherst,
and Wolfe, not having reached her when she wrote, as
Lord Lyttelton wrote to congratulate her on August 22,
“upon the glorious success of Admiral Boscawen. I
wrote last post to his lady, whom I love for a thousand
good qualities in herself and because she loves you.

Amherst or Wolfe at Fort St. Philips, we had not lost

for the fair sex were prophetic.</p>

<p>Tom writes to Mrs. Montagu on September 9,
giving her an account of his travels. Here is a description
of Hampton Court, Herefordshire, the seat of Lady
Coningsby—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The house stands at the end of a line of regular
planted trees, and looks more like a Monastery than a
nobleman’s house. The garden is very large, and would
have been pretty enough if Nature had been left in it
unmolested. In the middle of it is a piece of water of
about an acre, cut into two square lines, in which, to the
astonishment of the beholder, you see Neptune upon his
throne, and twenty Tritons waiting behind him. The
carver has express’d great fierceness in his countenance,
and well may the god who shakes the earth with his
Trident, be angry at being confined in a Pool, which
would scarce hold two hundred fish. From the garden
one might see a noble lawn bounded with an amphitheatre
of wood, was it not for the high Yew Hedges
clipt into a thousand ridiculous shapes which hinder the
eye from passing them, the park, too, is very large, but
so overrun with Bushes that some of the Lawns resemble
bogs.... From my Lady Coningsby’s we went
to my Lord Oxford’s, a place where nature has done a
great deal, which by a little money judiciously laid out
may be made the prettiest <i>ferme ornée</i> in England. My
Lord’s House is a very good one, built in a remarkable
good taste for the times of Queen Anne.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Lyttelton, as usual, adds a few words at the
end of the letter, and congratulates Mrs. Montagu on
the King of Prussia’s “most glorious success, but I am
in pain till I hear what has become of Emin.”</p>

I will give you some particulars. Eighteen thousand
killed by their own account, 6 generals killed, I don’t

the King’s Camp, 73 pieces of cannon taken, the military
chest with 850,000 Rubles. General Brown killed, refusing
quarter. The Russian infantry as they had
behaved like Bears, fought like Lyons, part of Count
Dohna’s foot gave way, or else it had been a most compleat
victory. The King himself took the colours in his
hand and brought ’em on again, sure this is too bold for
anybody but an immortal and invulnerable. He had two
aide-de-camps killed.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMIN DISCONSOLATE — THE KING OF PRUSSIA</div>

<p>On September 9 Emin wrote a long letter from the
Duke of Marlborough’s Quarter in Germany, whither
he had retired disconsolate at not being allowed to
fight in the battle by General Yorke, Lady Anson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
brother, to whom he had been recommended by her.
Meanwhile he had marched four days with the Army,
and the King of Prussia had taken notice of him, staring
at him hard and saying to Mr. Mitchell he wished he
had 12,000 men like him. Emin wished he had a letter
to the King, and was furious at General Yorke’s forbidding
him to fight; probably the General was too
anxious for his safety. The following description of
the King of Prussia is so interesting I insert it, the
whole letter to Mrs. Montagu, a folio sheet closely
written, being too long:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will do my endeavour to describe the King of
Prussia’s person, and his way of living. He is no taller
than Emin the Persian, he has a short neck, he has one
of the finest made heads ever I saw in my life, with a
noble forehead; he wears a false wigg, he has very handsome
nose. His eyes are grey, sharp and lively, ready
to pearce one through and through. He likes a man
that looks him in the face when he is talking to him.
He is well made everywhere, with a bend back, not
stupid (<i>sic</i>, stooped?) at all, like many Europeans. His
voice is the sweetest and clearest ever I heard. He takes
a great quantity of Spanish snuff, from his nose down to
the buckles of his shoes or boots is all painted with that
confounded stuff. His hands are as red as paint, as if
he was a painter, grizy all over. He dines commonly
between twelve and one, and drinks a bottle of wine at
his dinner. I was told that he was very unhealthy in
the time of peace, but since this war he has grown healthy,
and left off drinking a great quantity of coffee, which he
did formerly. All the satisfaction that I have, which is
great enough that I have seen Cæsar alive, nay twenty
times greater, he is more like King Solomon, for he
rules his nation by wisdom and understanding.... His
armies are not only disciplined to the use of arms, but
very religious, and say their prayers three times a day:
it is never neglected, even when they are on the march.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span></p>

<p>Emin winds up with a message of apology to Mr.
Burke at not having written to him from want of time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE</div>

<p>Meanwhile his adored Mrs. Montagu had nearly lost
her life through the carelessness of a maid. It happened
on September 3. Writing to Sarah Scott, she gives this
description—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On this day sennight at 4 in the morn I was seized
with a fainting fit, in which I lay some time, my maids
in their fright let the <i>eau de luce</i> fall into my eye,
nostril and mouth, my eyes were enflamed and nostril,
the mouth and uvula of the throat excoriated. After a
long and cruel struggle for life,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> a most sharp contention
with this medicine, I awaken’d to find myself in
this terrible condition. Dr. Askew unhappily lay at
Durham that night, so had no assistance till 2 at noon,
then I was blooded, which abated the inflammation so
far I could articulate. The Doctor told me my safety
depended on frequent gargling and drinking, so for, four
days, I was never a quarter of an hour without doing
so, the spitting was more violent than from a mercurial
salivation.... When I came out of my fit, to see
blood running from eye, nose and mouth drove Mr.
Montagu almost distracted, and I knew not which way
my agonies would end.... Mr. Montagu has shown
on this occasion the most passionate love imaginable.
Dr. Askew has been very careful, and an excellent
apothecary has watched me night and day.”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_209" href="#FNanchor_209" class="label">[209]</a> For two days her life was despaired of; for four days she could
swallow no solid, and was salivated for a week.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In a second letter she says, “On the fourth day when
I was able to look up I was surprized at the impression
concern had made on Mr. Montagu, and I should hardly
have known him, he looked 20 years older at least.”</p>

<p>In a letter of Monsey’s we learn <i>eau de luce</i> was
made of strong sal ammoniac and quicklime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LADY BURLINGTON</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu’s sister, now Lady Medows, wrote on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
September 14 to say her brother-in-law, Sir Philip, had
been nearly killed in the same way by hartshorn. At
the end of the letter she says, “Lady Bath dyed at two
this morning of the Palsy.” This was the wife of
Pulteney, Earl of Bath, soon after this to become one
of Mrs. Montagu’s most intimate friends. Lady Bath’s
maiden name was Maria Gumley, daughter and heiress
of a great glass manufacturer. She had the character
of great penuriousness, and her husband was credited
with the same character, but I hope to show later
that he could be very generous. When the news of
Mrs. Montagu’s accident spread amongst her numerous
friends, many were the letters of condolence and rejoicing
at her safety from Lord Lyttelton and a host of others.
Dr. Monsey had been staying with the Garricks; he was
a great admirer of Mrs. Garrick, whom he often quotes in
his letters. It was whilst staying with them he heard of
it. Both he and Lord Lyttelton were quite frantic at
the risk she had run, and distressed at her fainting fit.
Monsey was suffering from a bad cough, for which,
when staying with Sir John Evelyn at Wooton, he
tried bleeding, cathartics, and syrup of white poppies.
He returned to St. James’s, where Mrs. Garrick
came to sit with him, and cheer him up. In a letter of
his to Mrs. Montagu of September 23, mention is made
of Lady Burlington’s death. “Lady Burlington is dead.
Mrs. G(arrick) gets nothing, but rid of her, and that’s a
great deal, I think. She gives the Duke of D. £3000
per annum ... not a farthing to any one servant, she
had some lived with her 20 or 25 years.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. GARRICK</div>

<p>Lady Burlington, widow of the 3rd Earl, the celebrated
amateur architect, was the daughter of William,
Marquis of Halifax. On Eva Marie Viegel’s<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> arrival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
in England from Austria, the Empress Queen, Maria
Theresa, gave her a recommendation to Lady Burlington,
who received her at Burlington House as an inmate. It
is said “La Violette,” as she was called from her exquisite
dancing in the operas, had attracted the Emperor of
Austria’s attention so much as to alarm the Empress,
and that she therefore sought to remove her from
Austria. Lady Burlington strongly objected to Garrick’s
attachment to La Violette, having more ambitious projects
for her <i>protégée</i>, but it was a true love affair from
the beginning even to the end, and not one word could
ever be said against Mrs. Garrick; theirs was indeed
a love match, and after fifteen years of married life
Garrick presented her with a ring on her birthday,
with the most touching love verses. From the
letters, I gather it was Dr. Monsey who brought
Mrs. Montagu into personal intercourse with the
Garricks.</p>

<p>Dr. Monsey was so disturbed at Mrs. Montagu’s
accident that he wrote almost daily to her, and no one
who reads his letters could imagine, however eccentric
he was, that he was a free thinker in religion, as is
asserted in the “<cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>.”
His letters are so long that it is impossible to print
them in full in this book. He had a bad cough and
a sort of vertigo at this time, in the midst of which he
was called to the Earl of Northumberland, who was
desperately ill, whose sufferings Monsey succeeded in
alleviating. In a letter of October 8 we learn that his
birthday and Mrs. Montagu’s were on the same day,
viz. October 2.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> He promises in joke to marry Mrs.
Stuart, a widow lady who had nursed Mrs. Montagu

<div class="sidenote">CARVILLE</div>

<p>Writing on October 20 to Dr. Stillingfleet, who was
exploring Wales with Charles Lyttelton, the Dean of
Exeter and brother of Lord Lyttelton, Mrs. Montagu
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Carville<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> is just at the end of the Picts’ Wall, it
makes part of our enclosures, and we have a Roman
Altar in the stables. The din of War has so frightened
the rural Deities that even the long time that has
passed since the Union with Scotland, has not brought
them to make their residence with us. Pan, Ceres,
and Pomona, seem to neglect us; we are under the
domination of the god of mines. There is a great deal
of rich land in this country, but agriculture is ill understood.
The great gain made by several branches of the
coal trade has turned all attention that way. Every
gentleman in the country, from the least to the greatest,
is as solicitous in the pursuit of gain as a tradesman.
The conversation always turns upon money; the
moment you name a man, you are told what he is
worth, the losses he has had, or the profit he has made
by coal mines. As my mind is not naturally set to this
tune, I should often be glad to change it for a song from
one of your Welch Bards.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lowther had asked her to spend some time at
Lowther Hall,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> of which she says, “Lowther is much

<p>Mrs. Montagu, being attacked by a choleraic disorder,
which kept her in her room a week, and being
still very hoarse from the <i>eau de Luce</i>, Mr. Montagu
insisted on her returning to London before himself, so
as to be in reach of Dr. Monsey. On November 6, from
Wexford, she writes to Sarah Scott to inform her she
is returning to London. Mr. Montagu had accompanied
her three days’ journey; he then returned to Carville.
She had left behind the post-chaise, and travelled in
the “body coach, but my horses are so stout I believe
they will perform the journey from Carville to London
in seven days.” <i>En route</i> she picks up Mr. Tom Pitt,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
nephew of Miss Pitt and a friend of his, and carries
them to Durham, putting her maid into their post-chaise.
“My gentlemen leave me at Stilton, from
whence they go to Cambridge.” She mentions that
Mr. Montagu had bought all the jewels belonging to
Mr. Rogers for her, “and to-day intimated he should
give me a great purse of old gold which fell to his
share in the division; some of the pieces are curious,
but there will be between £60 to £70 of money that
one may spend with a good conscience.”</p>

<p>Arrived in London, Mrs. Montagu writes to her
husband that his sister, Lady Medows,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> was in very
bad health, and she had recommended her to take
“Viper broth!” if her doctor approved it, “as it is
a nourishing food, and by its quality supplies deficiency
of food.” I believe vipers are still used as medicine in
France, but whether in England I know not; perhaps
“Brusher Mills,”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> the famous New Forest snake-catcher,
could inform one; it does not sound inviting! In the
same letter she mentions having secured a berth as
midshipman for Montagu Isaacson,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Mr. Montagu’s
cousin, with Admiral Boscawen. The Admiral had
been most graciously received by the King, “and
nothing can exceed the honours the Admiral meets
with from all quarters.”</p>

<p>A Scotch gardener had been hired for Sandleford,
and she adds, “The Scotch Gardener was tired a little,
so I thought you would not dislike his recreating

him to the play to-night.”</p>

than a young toast, he has seen St. Paul’s, Westminster
Abbey, etc., and sees them with taste; his mind was
made for a higher condition of life.” Mentioning the
horses, she says she shall send three to Sandleford,
“it is a shame for a little animal as I am to keep 7
horses in town.” The team for a big coach was then
six, but a seventh was ridden alongside by a servant in

<p>Great anxiety reigned for some days about the health
of little Morris Robinson, Morris’s son. Dr. Monsey
stayed with the child four days and nights, and he pulled
through, but it painfully reminded his aunt of her loss
in little “Punch,” Morris being much of the same age.
Dr. Monsey wrote to Mr. Montagu to say he had
insisted, when the child was at its worst, that Mrs.
Montagu should not come to see it. Mention is made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>of young Mr. Pitt “just come to town, not so well as
when you saw him; he was here on Tuesday night,

<div class="sidenote">MEETING OF PARLIAMENT</div>

<p>On November 23 both houses of Parliament met at

her husband—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Pitt opened the session on Tuesday with a very
fine speech, Mr. Beckford stood up and said the turn
things had taken of late had put him in good humour, so
that he was willing to give two millions towards the
war on the Continent; he thought it too little to be of
service, but rather more than could be got. Mr. Pitt
answered the sum must not be limited, a great deal
indeed would be wanted, he knew not how it would be
raised, for he did not concern himself with Treasury
business, but the honourable gentleman, signifying Mr.
Legge, understood these matters, and he did not doubt
would raise a proper sum. Poor Legge looked distressed.
No one knows how these great sums are to
be raised, taxes on Dogs and publick diversions are
talked of, the King is much pleased with his Secretary’s
declaration of a support of the continent interest at any
rate. I hear Mr. Pitt’s speech was much admired, and
nowhere more than at St. James’s.... Mr. Pitt has a
personal dignity that supports open measures, and I am
glad he does not learn the political art of prevarication.
He has the people’s intire confidence, and I hope he will
use it to good ends.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMIN HOME AGAIN</div>

<p>On December 2, writing to Mr. Montagu, she says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Emin is come home, he has a great loss of the
Duke of Marlborough, who called him his Lion and kept
him always with him. He has been a sort of aide-de-camp
to Count Schullenburg; he has lately been in
Holland where the Armenians have promised to assist
his schemes. Lady Yarmouth has him with her in a
morning and promises him her interest with a very
great man; Lord Northumberland, Lord Anson, and
General York are to be his advocates with Mr. Pitt.
He is an astonishing creature to take thus with all kinds
of people. He hopes to go home in January in a sort of
public character. He is full of anecdotes of the King of
Prussia. He says his eyes and forehead are just like
mine, and he is as particular in his description of him as
a portrait painter would be. He marched with him
seven days, the Prussian Hero is as easy and familiar as
a private man, knowing his character will give him more
respect than his rank: it is not advisable in general for
Princes to lay aside their rank lest they should not
otherwise gain respect, but a truly great man is above
all respect that is not personal.”</p>
</div>

<p>A set of verses sent by Dr. Monsey from North
Mimms to Lord Lyttelton is amusing, but too prolix to

which are rank doggerel.</p>

<p>Louisburg had been taken on July 27. On December 7
Mrs. Montagu writes, “The House of Commons
yesterday returned thanks to Admiral Boscawen and
General Amherst for their services at Louisburg, and to
Admiral Osborne for his conduct in the Mediterranean.”</p>

<p>Dr. Monsey had been reading the “<cite>Memoirs of

to Mrs. Montagu.</p>

<p>“I take her into my hand and you into my mind as

instead of a foreign Princess whom he must study to
please, he chose a woman who made it her whole business
to please him, the only one who could inspire him
with a lasting passion, and so revered that in the admiration
which the recital of her vertues occasioned he cried,
‘Let us go and shut ourselves up to talk of this woman.’

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Parliaments meet on the 16th ... the ardour

France, very amiable in his private character, good-natured,
liberal and witty, so has many disciples at
Paris from respect to his person; I fear he will have
many here from respect to his doctrines well adapted
to the corruptions of the human heart. He endeavours
to show it is custom makes virtue and vice, like Epicurus,
placing his good in pleasure but not his pleasure in
good. He thinks a less strict observation of some
moral rules would make man in general happier. He
would trust everything to laws, Legislature is to be the
god and conscience of mankind. He does not consider
how many by their situation are above laws, how many
one may say are below it, and how many more by
fraud, evasions, concealment would hope to escape it.
I hope conscience, call’d by Mr. Pope ‘the god within

for want of alliances or other means, they were quietly

of settling a theatre at Geneva, which treats of

<p>“<cite>Lord Lyttelton’s History</cite> is not yet ready to

scrupulously exact in following truth. His delicacy in
regard to characters, his candour in regard to opinions,
his precision in facts, would entitle him to the best palm
history can claim, if he had not added to these virtues
of History (if I may call them so) the highest ornaments

and writing an ingenious and ingenuous man,
modest and delicate, and on great and serious subjects
full of that respect and veneration which a good mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>

<p>Soon after this letter, Mrs. Carter paid her first visit
to Mrs. Montagu in Hill Street. Mrs. Carter had been
much troubled by the severe illness of Miss Talbot,
her bosom friend, and of Archbishop Secker, with
whom the Talbots lived. Mrs. Montagu, writing to
condole about this, mentions that Lord Waldegrave<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
was going to marry the illegitimate daughter of Sir
Edward Walpole, and she continues—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Miss Kitty Fisher modestly asked Earl Pembroke<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
to make her a Countess; his family love forms, so
perhaps the fair one thought he would approve the
legal form of cohabitation; but he hesitated, and so the

£1000 for present decorations.”</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu had now returned to his wife, having
bought another portion of the Denton estate from Mr.
Archdeacon, his cousin. He made a codicil to his
previous will of 1752, leaving his wife the whole property,
as well as all he possessed besides. The codicil
was witnessed by Ben Stillingfleet, William Archdeacon,
and Samuel Torriano, on April 12, 1759.</p>

a woman of talent and literary attainments, who had been
a constant companion of his late wife. Her eyes being
affected with an incurable cataract, she became blind,
and Dr. Johnson was trying to raise money enough
to buy an annuity for her. In 1766 she became a
permanent inmate of Johnson’s house, and on Mr.
Montagu’s death in 1775, Mrs. Montagu settled £10 per

<p>Dr. Johnson’s writing is singularly clear, and, once
seen, is unmistakable, from his peculiar long <i>s</i>’s.</p>

<p>On June 9 also, Emin wrote on board the <i>Prince
Edward</i>, from the Mole of Genoa, where they were in
quarantine. The letter begins, “To the most learned
and most magnanimous Mrs. Montagu.” He was on his
way to see Prince Heraclius with letters of recommendation
from his father and all the principal Armenians
of Calcutta and India to the Prince and the Archbishop
of Armenia. At last his transcendent merit as a leader
had been acknowledged by his own countrymen, who
now designated him “their chief, their Shepherd and
Protector.” Emin’s affectionate heart was rent at the
thought of parting with his kind English protectors,
and in this letter he says he was almost glad when he
found most of them out or away from home when he
called to bid adieu. He was to cross Turkey by land
to get to Armenia, a most dangerous Journey, and on
the way out two ships had chased them for four or five
hours off Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LADY ESSEX’S DEATH</div>

<p>Writing from Sandleford on July 25 to Mrs. Carter,
Mrs. Montagu narrates the sad death of Lady Essex,
carried away at the early age of nineteen by puerperal
fever and throat disease. She was the daughter of Lady
Frances Williams, who was bowed down with this
affliction, added to the terrible lunacy of her husband.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>

<p>“I am glad you agree with me in detestation of
Voltaire’s Optimism. Are not you provoked that such

downright rebel to his God. Some good may arise

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I conducted Mrs. Pitt to Maidenhead Bridge on
Tuesday, and on Wednesday dined at Mrs. Clayton’s<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
at Harleyford.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> I think it the most agreeable situation

every object speaks peace and plenty, the silver
Thames glides at the foot of their garden, lofty trees
crown the summit, they have fine prospects, sweet
lawns, fine cornfields and distant villages.... I could
not get permission from Mr. Montagu to stay a day or
two, but had barely leave for a dining visit; to my great
mortification, my Landlord at the Bridge told me that
to go by Marlow would carry me 8 or 9 miles out of the
Road, so I gave up my scheme, but met Mr. Amyand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
who was travelling through Maidenhead town: he
jumped out of his post-chaise, got into the coach to tell
me all the news of the town, and on my complaining
of my disappointment in regard to Mrs. Clayton, he
assured me if I would go two miles out of my road I
should find myself on the bank of the river opposite
Mrs. Clayton’s house, that then I might go on board a
flat-bottom’d boat and invade her territories. I followed
his directions, but as my coach could not pass the river,
I proposed only to drink a dish of Chocolate, walk
round her gardens, and proceed to Reading. She
kindly desired to carry me thither early in the afternoon,
said she would get Mrs. Southwell<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> of the party,
that my coach should go on to Reading and I should
find my horses refreshed and ready to set forward for
Sandleford: no magical wand could have made a metamorphosis
more to my advantage than converting the
rose Parlour at the Inn in Reading into an elegant
<i lang="fr">salon</i>, and my Landlord and his wife into Mrs. Clayton
and Mrs. Southwell; and an empty coach into one filled
with good company. A most incomparable dinner
appeared, and Mrs. Southwell; we went together
to Reading, and by 11 I got back to my darksome
pines.”</p>

<p>Soon after her return to Sandleford, Mr. Montagu
fell ill of a bad throat, caught, she thought, at a place
built by a Mr. Cottington near Newbury, on such a hill
that, as she says to Lyttelton,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“it would have made a good situation for a college of
Augurs, for here they might conveniently make observations
on the flight of Birds; the ascent is so steep a goat

the house, where perhaps he hoped to sit as umpire in
the battles between the cranes and the pigmies, for as
to looking down from it, it is rather horrible.”</p>

<p>Lord Lyttelton and “Tom” were taking a tour to
the Highlands, having gone from Hagley to Durham,
thence to Lord Ravensworth’s and Morpeth, “on our
way to Alnwick.” Lord Lyttelton alludes to the Battle
of Minden, fought on August 1, between the English,
Hessians, and Hanoverians, against the French. Prince
Ferdinand<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> of Brunswick commanded, and under him
Lord George Sackville,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> who commanded the English
and Hanoverians, and incurred some obloquy on the
score of disobeying orders; but Lyttelton says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The necessity the French will be under of restoring
their army in Germany by large reinforcements must,
I think, putt an end to their intended invasion, and
you Ladies of Britain will not be exposed to the outrages
and brutalities which the poor Ladies of Hildesheim
have suffered from the rage of those polished barbarians....
I had writt thus far at Taymouth, Lord Breadalbane’s
fine seat, but was forced by some interruption to delay
ending my letter till I came to Inverary, from whence I
now write. The House deserves to be call’d, as it was
stil’d by Lord Leicester, ‘the Royall Palace of the King
of the Goths.’ He reigns here in great state, but Nature
reigns in still greater. I have scarce ever seen her more
sublimely majestick; nor does she want some sweet
graces to soften her dignity and make it more amiable.

<div class="sidenote">ALNWICK</div>

<p>Tom Lyttelton, who was travelling with his father
in Scotland, writes on September 10 from Edinburgh to
Mrs. Montagu. Some portions of his letter I copy—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The first place I shall mention to you is Alnwick,
the seat of the Earl of Northumberland. The Castle is
very gracious, and stands on the brow of a hill; it was
formerly very strong. His Lordship has shown great
judgment in the manner of fitting it up, for instead of
using the modern stile of architecture (as Mr. Lumley
has done at Lumley Castle), he has left it for the
most part as it was in Harry Percy’s time, with this
difference, that two or three rooms which were before
ill proportioned and quite unfurnished, are now much
enlarged and fitted very handsomely in the Gothick stile.
He will add many more rooms on the other side of the
court, and will make it in time a very good house, still
preserving its original character. From thence we went
to Berwick to Sir Hugh Dalrymple’s.... The Bass
Island is all a vast Rock broken into many rough and
irregular pieces; it is inaccessible to very large ships,
there is but one place where a boat may safely land; in
the middle of the ascent there are still the remains of an
old castle, which was a state prison with houses for
soldiers built in the rock; they tell you that within these
sixty years it was garrisoned, but it is now become the
habitation only of an infinite number of sea birds, of
which the Solan goose is the most remarkable.... We
went to dine with Mr. Charters, and from thence the
same night reached Edinburgh, and were lodged in the
Royal Palace called <i>Holy Rood House</i>.... My next shall
be from Bishops Auckland (a seat of the Bishop of
Durham’s)....”</p>
</div>

<p>As usual, Lord Lyttelton adds a postscript, and in
it says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We dined to-day with the Magistrates and corporation
of Edinburgh, and supped with the Duke of Argyll,
who honoured me with his presence at the dinner, a distinction
he never paid to any other than upon this occasion.
Tom and I had our freedoms given us, as we have
had from many other towns with as great compliments
as if I had been a minister of State, or the Head of a
faction.”</p>
</div>

<p>Young Edward Wortley Montagu writes on September
13 to Mr. Montagu from “Mrs. Lyster’s in Hyde
Street, Bloomsbury Market,” to say—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am really greatly concern’d that it has hitherto
been out of my power to wait upon you, and I am
afraid will be so the whole summer, for my book is
sold off, and Millar presses me for a second edition,
which I am now about, and since I wish it should
appear in the world as perfect as possible, I must beg
the favour of you to let me know what corrections you
think it may want; the world received the first edition
with great indulgence, but the second will have a right
to approbation when it has received a greater degree
of perfection from the corrections of a gentleman of
your abilities.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">YORK</div>

<p>In an answer to Lord Lyttelton’s letter from Inverary,
too long to be inserted, Mrs. Montagu mentions that she
is sending the letter to York—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall be glad to hear that your Lordship and Mr.
Lyttelton like York, to which perhaps I am partial as to
the place of my nativity. One of the strongest pictures
in my mind is the funeral of a Dean of York, which
I saw performed with great solemnity in the Cathedral
when I was about 4 years old.... I know, my lord,
you will rejoice with me for Mr. Boscawen’s<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> victory,
both from public spirit and private friendship.”</p>

<p>Emin, after a serious illness, was setting off on his
dangerous journey through Turkey, and on September 20
wrote “To the Montagu the Great,” ending up with,
“My dearest, brightest and the wisest Queen of the East,
your very affectionate and faithful, obedient, humble
servant and soldier, Emin of Hasnasari in Persia.”</p>

<p>Lord Lyttelton and his son travelled from Edinburgh
to Lord Hopetoun’s place, Hopetoun House. In a
letter to Mrs. Montagu of September 21, Tom says,
“There is one chimney piece done by Risback that
cost £600, my father thinks it the finest he ever saw.”
Thence they proceeded to Stirling, and paid visits to
Lord Cathcart and Lord Kinnoull; thence to Glamis
Castle, which he describes “as a very old castle, but
has not a tolerable apartment, and can never be altered
much for the better.” He does not mention the ghost;
probably he was not told about it. From thence to the
Duke of Athole’s at Dunkeld, where he is enraptured
with the country, and mentions the window at the
Hermitage,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> “through which the falls of the Braan
appear as a surprise to the visitor.” The Lytteltons
accompanied the duke to his other seat, Blair Athole,
after which they proceeded to Taymouth, Lord Breadalbane’s
splendid place, which enchanted Tom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCOTCH CHARACTERISTICS</div>

<p>He now gives Mrs. Montagu a sort of character
sketch of the Scottish nobility—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The characteristical virtues of the Scotch are courage,
temperance, prudence, economy and hospitality. This
last is not only peculiar to the nobility, but is universally
practised by all kinds of people. <i>Good breeding</i>, though
it cannot be properly styled a virtue, is of the highest
<i>consequence</i> to Society. This the Scotch universally
possess, and there is not in the North such a character
as that of an English country Squire, whose whole life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
is spent in the laudable customs of hunting, drinking,
swearing and sleeping.... Scotch ladies are very
handsome and very sweet-tempered. It is their general
character to be rather too free of their favours before
marriage; however that may be, they are very chaste
after that ceremony. They breed up their children in a
particular manner, for they are accustomed from their
infancy to go without shoes and stockings, nor in the
coldest weather do their parents permit them to wear a
great-coat; if they are of a puny constitution they die,
if not, they are the better for it all their life.”</p>
</div>

<p>He also remarks that “few of the nobility omit going
to Church on a Sunday, and what is of more importance,
when they are there they do not trifle, but seem seriously
to reflect upon the duty they owe their Maker.” This
description from a boy of fifteen is remarkable, and
throws light upon English manners of that period.
After several other visits, Tom returned to his studies
at Eton.</p>

I put it in your power to exert your good-nature. I
know it is your foible to carry this principle to an extream,
and one is almost sure of success in any application,
or at least for pardon for having made an improper
one, when we know judiciously to take advantage of a
person’s weak point. I do not know anything else
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>which could give me confidence enough to take the
Liberty I am now going to use. The Consulship of
Madrid has been vacant for several months; I am informed
that it is in the gift of Mr. Secretary Pitt, and
that it is valuable. I presume, however, that it is not
an object for a person who has any considerable pretensions,
by its having continued so long vacant, else I
should never have thought of it. My interest is weak,
I have not at all the honour of being known to Mr. Pitt;
nor much to any of his close connections. For which
reason I venture to ask your advice whether I can with
propriety proceed at all in this affair, and if you think
I ought to undertake it, in what manner it would be
proper for me to proceed. If my little suit either in
itself or in the persons through whose hands it must
necessarily pass, should be attended with any circumstances
that may make it disagreeable to you to interfere
in it, I shall take it as a favour equal to that I have
asked, if you will be so good to tell me you can do
nothing in it. I shall think such a declaration a great
mark of your confidence. I am sensible that there are
in all people’s connections many points that may make
a person of delicacy unwilling to ask a favour in some
quarters, and yet more unwilling from the same delicacy
to tell the person for whom it is to be asked that they
have such difficulties. There are undoubtedly many
circumstances of propriety in every person’s situation,
which none can feel properly but themselves. I am
not, however, if I know myself, one of those expectants
who think everything ought to be sacrificed to their
Interest. It occurred to me that a letter from you to
Miss Pitt might be of great service to me. I thought
too of mentioning Mrs. Boscawen. The Admiral has
such great merit with the Ministry and the Nation, that
the want of it will be the more readily overlooked in
any person for whom he may be induced to apply. But
these are crude notions and require the understanding
they are submitted to, to bring them to form and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>dwelt so long upon so indifferent a subject. Your
Patience is almost equal to the rest of your virtues if
you can bear it. I dwell with far more pleasure on my
acknowledgments for what you have done for my
friend<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> in so obliging and genteel a manner. He has
but just now succeeded after a world of delays, and no
small opposition. He will always retain a very grateful
sense of what you have done in his favour. Mrs.
Burke<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> desires me to present her respects to you, and
her best wishes for your health. When last I had the
pleasure of seeing Dr. Monsey, he told me that the
country still agreed with you, else I should most
wickedly wish this fine weather over that you might
be the sooner driven to town. This fine weather suffers
nothing good to be in Town but itself. We are much
obliged to the Doctor for the satisfaction he gave you
in uniting his care with yours for Mr. Montagu’s
recovery. I congratulate you very sincerely on that
event. If I could find some agreeable circumstance in
your affairs for congratulation as often as I wish I
should be the most troublesome correspondent in
England, for nobody can be with greater respect and
gratitude,</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL TOWNSHEND — GENERAL WOLFE</div>

<p>In a letter to Lord Lyttelton of October 23, Mrs.
Montagu mentions visiting Lady Townshend to congratulate
her on the taking of Quebec, which had
happened on September 13, and in which her son,
General Townshend, had taken a prominent part. In
this she says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The encomiums on Mr. Wolfe run very high, a
great action is performed and every one can endure
to give praise to a dead man; and there was certainly
something very captivating in his character; he took
the public opinion by a <i>coup de main</i>, to which it surrenders
more willingly than to a regular siege. The
people had not time to be tired of hearing him called
the brave; he is the subject of all people’s praise, and
I question whether all the Duke of Marlborough’s conquests
gained him greater honour.”</p>
</div>

<p>In answer to this Lord Lyttelton says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wish that a French invasion from Havre de Grace,
which I have particular reasons to be more afraid of
than ever, may not correct the extravagance of our joy
for our unexpected success at Quebec, and the false
security it has produced in the minds of our ministers....
Mr. Bonus, the picture cleaner, has come down and
has restored my old family pictures to such a state of
perfection that I can hardly believe my eyes when I see
them. Few gentlemen, I assure you, have a finer collection
than mine appears to be now. If Lady Coventry
ever comes here, she will cry at the sight of some of
the beauties of Charles the Second’s court, which by
Mr. Bonus’ help exceed hers as much as she does my
milkmaids. There is particularly a Duchess of Richmond
whom you have read of under the name of
Mademoiselle Stuart in the ‘<cite>Memoirs of the Count de
Grammont</cite>,’ whose charms are so divine that my nephew
Pitt is absolutely falling in love with her and does
nothing but gaze upon her from morning till night.
What would you living beauties give if twenty years
hence, when you begin to suffer by time, there could be
found a Mr. Bonus to restore you again, as he has done
this fair lady and others at Hagley? Pray come and
see the miracles of his art....</p>

<p>“Pitt sends his best compliments, and we both agree
you have indeed a great deal of a witch about you, but
nothing of a Hag.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Montagu evidently refused to exert her influence
in favour of Mr. Burke’s desire to obtain the
Madrid Consulship, as on October 6 he writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“For many publick as well as private reasons
I am sorry that you have not an influence on Ministers
of State; but the qualities which some persons possess
are by no means those which lead to Ministerial
influence. The reasons you have been pleased to give
me for not making the application are very convincing
and obliging. Before I applied I was well aware of the
difficulties that stood in my way.”</p>
</div>

<p>Further down in the letter (which is not sufficiently
interesting to be given <i>in extenso</i>) he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is not very easy to have access to Mr. Pitt,

<div class="sidenote">“TRISTRAM SHANDY” — THE REV. LAURENCE STERNE</div>

<p>Though undated, the following letter of Laurence
Sterne may be placed here. Early in 1759 he had been
writing the first two volumes of “<cite>Tristram Shandy</cite>,”
towards the end of the year he was in London arranging
for their publication with Dodsley the publisher, who
declined the venture. They were printed for and sold
by John Hinxham, bookseller in Stonegate, according
to <cite>Mr. Traill’s volume on Sterne in the “Englishmen of
Letters” series</cite>. The allusions to the Dean of York,
etc., referred to a dispute between a Dr. Topham and
Dr. Fountayne (Dean of York), in which Sterne sided
with the Dean when he wrote his “<cite>History of a Good
Warm Watchcoat</cite>,” “a sarcastic apologue,” as Mr. Traill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
terms it. I have not time or knowledge enough to enter
into the details of this affair, but hope the letter may
throw light upon it to students of Sterne’s character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I never was so much at a loss as I find
myself at this instant that I am going to answer the
letter I have had the honour and happiness to receive
from you by Mr. Torriano; being ten times more
oppress’d with the excess of your candour and goodness
than I was before with the subject of my complaint.
It was entirely owing to the Idea I had in common
with all the world of Mrs. Montagu’s that I felt sorrow
at all—or communicated what I felt to my friend; which
last step I should not have taken but from the great
reliance I had upon the excellency of your character.
I wanted mercy—but not sacrifice, and am obliged,
in my turn, to beg pardon of you, which I do from my
soul, for putting you to the pain of excusing, what in
fact was more a misfortune, than a fault, and but a
necessary consequence of a train of Impressions given
to my disadvantage. The Chancellor of York, Dr.
Herring, was, I suppose, the person who interested
himself in the honour of the Dean of York, and requested
that act of friendship to be done to the Dean, by bringing
about a separation betwixt the Dean and myself—the
poor gentleman has been labouring this point many
years—but not out of zeal for the Dean’s character, but
to secure the next residentiaryship to the Dean of St.
Asalph, his son; he was outwitted himself at last,
and has now all the foul play to settle with his conscience
without gaining or being ever likely to gain
his purpose. I take the liberty of enclosing a letter
I wrote last month to the Dean, which will give some
light into my hard measure, and show you that I was
as much a protection to the Dean of York—as he to me.
The answer to this has made me easy with regard to
my views in the Church of York, and as it has cemented
anew the Dean and myself beyond the power of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
future breach, I thought it would give you satisfaction
to see how my interests stand, and how much and how
undeserved I have been abused: when you have read
it—it shall never be read more, for reasons your
penetration will see at once.</p>

<p>“I return you thanks for the interest you took in my
wife, and there is not an honest man, who will not do
me the justice to say, I have ever given her the character
of as moral and virtuous a woman as ever God made—what
occasion’d discontent ever betwixt us is now no
more—we have settled accounts to each other’s satisfaction
and honour, and I am persuaded shall end our days
without one word of reproach or even Incivility.</p>

<p>“Mr. Torriano made me happy in acquainting me
that I was to dine with you on Friday; it shall ever be
my care as well as my Principle ever to behave so that
you may have no cause to repent of your goodness
to me.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cou’d Mrs. Montagu think this the way to make a
bad husband better, she might indeed have found a
better, which I have often urg’d, though to little purpose,
namely some little mark of kindness or regard to me as
a kinswoman, I meant not such as would have cost her
money, but indeed this neither she or any one of the
Robinsons vouchsafed to do, though they have seen Mr.
Sterne frequently the last two winters, and will the
next, so that surely never poor girl who had done no
one thing to merit such neglect was ever so cast off by
her Relations as I have been. I writ three posts ago to
inform Mrs. Montagu of the sorrow her indifferation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>

was in her power to undo the mischief, though I can’t
for my soul see which way, and must expect to the last
hour of my life to be reproach’d by Mr. Sterne as the
blaster of his fortunes. I learn from Mr. Sterne that
there was both letters and conversations pass’d betwixt
them last winter on this subject, and though I was an
utter stranger to that and every part of this affair till
ten days ago, when the Chancellor wrote his first Letter,
which Mr. Sterne communicated to me. Yet in several
he wrote to me from London he talk’d much of the
honours and civilities Mrs. Montagu show’d him, which
I was well pleas’d to hear, as the contrary behaviour
must have wrought me sorrow. I only wish’d that
amongst them she had mixt some to her cousin, but that
I heard not one syllable of. I beg you will give me
one gleam of comfort by answering this directly. Mr.
Sterne is on the wing for London, and we remove to

<p>“My eyes have at last served me to read the collection
of letters which have afforded me much entertainment,
those from the illustrious I consider as written
in their theatrical character, for though they are written
behind the scenes, which gives them an air of reality,
they are made to suit the assumed character. Lord
B(ath) is Patriot and Philosopher, after the manner of
the Ancients, his letters bear a consular and stoical
dignity, and when I expect to see them signed Marcus,
Cato or Caius Cassius, he surprises me with a Christian
name and modern title. Those of another eminent
person appear more natural, though perhaps they are
not more sincere, but the modes we are used to by their
familiarity appear less constrained and artificial.... I
will send Mr. Lyttelton the Gazette extraordinary from
Quebec next post, it is from the Indian Savages, and expressed
in hieroglyphicks; it will give him an idea of
the expresses sent by the Mexicans and Montezuma. I
will send him the explanation with it.... Mr. Stewart

I believe, has some little employment given him by the

was formerly an Officer of the footguards, but being a
man of wit and pleasure, shared the common fate of that

and go to Jamaica, for (I doubt) more than suspicion
of debt. I am assured that he is now quite reformed,
and has a mind to be an honest man.</p>

Mercury and “Mrs. Modish,” a modern fine lady, in

<div class="sidenote">BALL AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS</div>

<p>In the next letter to her husband, who was going
to Sandleford, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I went to the ball last Friday, it was the first time
I had been to the publick rooms, and it had like to
have been fatal to me, for the coachman not being
acquainted with the place, the night dark, and having
no flambeaux, had like to have overturned just coming
out from Joy’s Rooms, down a place where the coach
would have been entirely topsy-turvy; the footmen
were thrown off from behind, but several people being
by, the coach was held up, and I got safe out, and no
hurt done to the persons or machine. My fright was
such I did not get my rest till six o’clock in the morning.
I had many civil messages in the morning, and Lord
and Lady Feversham came up the hill to inquire after
me; my nerves are still a little the worse. If the
coach had fallen it would have gone down some feet,
but the standers-by behaved with great humanity, bearing
a very heavy load on their shoulders. I believe
our new coachman is too lazy to serve us. The danger
I was in when John and the postillion were drunk and
had like to have overturned us on a gallop against a
post when we came from Windsor, and my second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
peril on Friday, makes me tremble whenever I get
into the machine.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A GENTLEMAN COACHMAN</div>

<p>To this Mr. Montagu replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I am more concerned than j can express at the
peril you were in. I tremble and shudder when j consider
how fatal the consequences might have been if you had
been actually overturned.... I have inquired after the
cause of this unhappy affair, and though Ned says he
cannot say the coachman was drunk, still he had been
at the Ale House, and when he came home said there
was no danger, and that the boys made almost as much
noise as his Mistress. I find he is a lazy, proud, and
what they call a gentleman coachman, and such as j
would very soon get rid of.”</p>
</div>

<p>Ned was the head groom, and Mrs. Montagu proposed
substituting him for the coachman, as he was
honest and sober. To this her husband replies, “I wish
he had more experience, but j should with all that think
j run no great hazard in trusting him, besides he might
practise to go out with the six horses of times when
you did not want him.” To turn a lumbering coach
and six must have been a most intricate affair. Ned
was promoted to be coachman, but only to practise with
the coach and six; “a coachman to a Mr. Lambard, and
afterwards to Captain Pannel’s heir,” was employed
when the coach went out, being then under a job-master,
one Mr. Jarret, and a chaise and pair conveyed Mrs.
Montagu to the Wells.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The gentleman here ordered the place of my danger
to be mended and acquainted me he had done so, and
hoped I should not be frighted away from the balls.</p>

<p>“Sir Roger Twisden inquired much after you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
my Father. He stays but a few days here. Lord Bath
was ill again yesterday, he told me he was mortified
that he had never been able to wait on me, but he was
so weak he could not venture to trouble any one with a
visit. I think he is in a bad way, but has a great deal
of witt whenever he is tolerably well. His Lordship, I
know, has been prejudiced in my favour by some of his
friends, who are also friends of mine and Mr. Domville
in particular, which I believe has given him a desire to
be acquainted with me, but I believe he will hardly be
able to make a visit this season, and in London he never
visits any one who does not inhabit a ground floor.
He has still a fine countenance, and those piercing
eyes that denote a mind extraordinarily lively and
penetrating.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF LORD BATH</div>

<p>William Pulteney, Earl of Bath, was born in April,
1684, hence he was at this period turned seventy-six.
He had lost his wife, <i>née</i> Anna Maria Gumley, in 1758.
Mrs. Montagu must have known him in a superficial
society way, as a description of a great rout given by
Lady Bath some years previously is in this book.
But now was to commence that tender intimacy and
affectionate friendship between them that lasted to his
death, and which prompted him, even in the act of
dying, to stagger from his bed and write a few lines
of adieu to her as his last effort—sacred lines which
I possess and treasure! For his political character I
must refer the reader to history, and the “<cite>Dictionary of
National Biography</cite>.” As regards his private character
I cannot do better than quote Elizabeth Carter’s account
of him in “<cite>Memoirs of her Life</cite>.” It was probable that
through Mrs. Carter, who was a great friend of his, he
began to appreciate the manifold charms of Elizabeth
Montagu. This is what Mrs. Carter says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“None of his friends, I believe, will remember him
longer and very few with equal affection. Indeed,
there was something in his conversation and manners
more engaging than can be described. With all those
talents which had so long rendered him the object of
popular admiration, he had not the least tincture of that
vanity and importance which is too often the consequence
of popular applause. He never took the lead in
conversation, or even assumed that superiority to which
he had a claim, as he was blessed with an exemption
from many of the pains and infirmities of old age; he
had none of its defects. In so many months as I was
continually in his company last year (1763), I do not
recollect a single instance of peevishness the whole
time. His temper always appeared equal. There was
a perpetual flow of vivacity and good humour in his
conversation, and the most attentive politeness in his
behaviour, nor was this the constrained effort of external
and partial good breeding, but the natural turn of
his mind, and operated so uniformly on all occasions
that I never heard him use a harsh or even an uncivil
expression to any of his servants.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">WINNING A COAL MINE</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu had been at Sandleford, where Morris,
his wife, and little boy were spending some time. The
little Morris was a great favourite, and delight to poor
Mr. Montagu, who loved children. He was now preparing
to set off northwards to Northumberland, having
two collieries which he was going to work, or, as the expression
was, to “win,” viz. Leamington and “Denton.”
The first would cost a £1000, the latter, now called
“Montagu’s main,” £5000. He consults his wife about
all this, and adds, “I think j shall not while j live get
rid of the trouble my succession has brought upon me,
and have only one object, who, j hope, will reap the
benefit of all my labour.” This meant his wife. At
Tunbridge his wife, with “all our fine ladies and gentlemen,”
was attending Mr. Ferguson’s lectures on Philosophy.
In a letter of Lord Lyttelton’s he mentions
his brother Richard. “Sir Richard, or rather ‘Duke
Lyttelton’s’<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Royall villa at Richmond, a finer room I
never saw, and he seems made to sitt in it, with all
the dignity of a gouty Prince. But though I greatly
admired it, I would not have his gout to have his room.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a id="Footnote_276" href="#FNanchor_276" class="label">[276]</a> He had married the Dowager Duchess of Bridgewater in 1745. She

</div>

her eyes being very weak, she had been reading</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“the new translation of Sophocles.... The <cite>Œdipus

because, though the translator tells us the Choruses of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>

<p>She adds that she has “sent 4 sets of dressing boxes
from hence as your Lordship desired. At the same
time I took the liberty to send on a cheap set of tea-cups
and coffee cups for a Tunbridge faring.” Lord Lyttelton
returns answer, saying, “I dined at Dicky Bateman’s
half gothick, half attick, half chinese and completely
fribble house.” There he met “my old Love, Lady
Hervey,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and my new love, Mrs. Hancock<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> not to mention
Lady Primrose,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> for whom I have a great friendship.”
Lord Lyttelton was highly delighted with a

the ‘<cite>Highland Poems</cite>,’<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and with great deference
urged the reasons which induced me to esteem them
genuine. His Lordship pays great compliment to what
I had said on the subject, answering other parts of my
letter with spirit and gaiety, and at last concludes that,
in spite of 83, without a voice, and with shaking hands,
he had endeavoured to follow my train of thought,

am perfectly satisfied as to the letter being safe, and
shall not wish to have it return’d till it is most convenient

must be a great comfort to every good mind to see how
religion can impart not only patience but even cheerfulness
under the greatest bodily infirmities. I find it will
be necessary to trouble your Grace with some explanation
of the Bishop’s letter. Before I went to Tunbridge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
I sent his Lordship the ‘<cite>Highland Poems</cite>,’<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> by the Dean
of York, and the day before I went to Tunbridge my
Lord sent them back with a very obliging note to thank
me for them, but express’d his opinion that they were
not genuine. I was a little distress’d by this favour, as
I had not an opportunity to wait on the Bishop before
my journey. I thought to write to him and assume the
air of being his correspondent would have too much
appearance of presumption, and not to thank him for
his note might look like neglect, so I waited till the
season allow’d me to send him some wheatears and to
assure him I wrote only as his poulterer. As it was
natural to take notice of what his Lordship had said
concerning the poems, I ventured with the utmost
deference to give the reasons why I should have believed
them to be genuine and original, and then return’d back
to my character of Poulterer and desir’d his Lordship to
forgive my presumption and order my letter to be put
on the wheatears when roasting to preserve them from
being burnt. I ask pardon for this long story, but it
was necessary as a key to the Bishop’s letter. Your
Grace will find some mistakes made by his Secretary.</p>

Grace Mr. Wortley Montague was gone abroad, he is in
England, but where is a secret even to his lawyer, and
those who are imploy’d on his affairs. I thought it
right to let your Grace know this, as it appears to me very
singular, as he is now under the protection of privilege.
I know you will be so good as not to mention I told your
Grace this unless it be to Lady Bute, who I should think
had better know this circumstance. I beg my best

<p class="greet2">“When I was a boy at Eton school, I remember
it was a Principle of the Law Marshall (practised
there): that he who gave the second blow was the
beginner of the Fray; and there is something in it, if
you consider it; however at this time, it will help to
excuse me from the Presumption and folly of inviting
you to a Combat, in which I can have no hopes of
success. When I read on, and observe with what
accuracy and finesse you trace the motions of the Heart,
and call Nature from the inmost recess’s to discover
plainly what arts is usually employ’d to conceal; I am
confounded.</p>

<p>“It is true indeed that you have named the Passions
and Qualifications of the person to be Described, but
what Work will a man make, who should think that he
had got all the Secrets; tho’ he was unacquainted or
incapable to understand it, to such a man. Alexander
the Great and <i>Diogines</i> (<i>sic</i>) are Characters alike, for
they were both Actuated by the Spirit of Ambition, one
who wanted a new World to display himself in, the
other valued nothing beyond the Tub he lived in. In
the midst of this Philosophical enquirey about the
Passions, you very artfully turn to your Family Affairs
and give (I doubt not) excellent directions to the Cook

either.</p>

<p>“Nothing, I think, is more disagreeable than Learning
in a Female, when the Mistress studys Newton,
which perhaps she neither does nor ever will understand,
to the absolute neglect of her Children and
Servants. You conclude by putting in your claim for
the Lady’s Privilege, which is a very extensive one;
give me leave to tell you a short story.</p>

<p>“There was a poor Printer who had got a little sum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>

Criminal, and he grew so fond of last words, that after
the Man had been long dead, he published another
paper called <span class="allsmcap">MORE</span> last words. Thus you see, Madam,
that I have in spite of eighty-three, without a Voice, and
with shaking Hands, endeavoured to follow your Strain
of thought, which I shall always look upon to be a very
good direction. My time of Life calls upon me to think
of other Subjects, and the greatest of all to <em>Justifie the
ways of God to men</em>. This theme can never wear out, it
takes in the whole of God’s Dispensation, with respect
to the Religion of the World, and shows by the connection
in the several parts that the whole is the work of

<p>On September 19 Mrs. Montagu set out from Hill
Street on her journey to Northumberland, starting in
a postchaise and picking up Ned and her own horses
at Baldock, and so reached Buckden on the same day.
She writes to Mr. Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I call’d on Dr. Young at Welling and staid about
two hours with him, he received me with great
cordiality, and I think appears in better health than
ever I saw him. His house is happily opposite to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
church yard, which is to him a fine prospect; he has
taught his imagination to sport with skulls like the
grave-digger in Hamlet. He invited me to stay all
night, and if my impatience to see you had not impell’d
me on, I had been tempted to it. His conversation has
always something in it very delightful; in the first place
it is animated by the warmest benevolence, then his
imagination soars above the material world, some
people would say his conversation is not natural. I
say it is natural of him to be unnatural, that is out of
the ordinary course of things. It would be easier for
him to give you a catalogue of the Stars than an inventory
of the Household furniture he uses every day.
The busy world may say what it pleases, but some men
were made for speculation, metaphysical men, like jars
and flower pots, make good furniture for a cabinet tho’
useless in the kitchen, the pantry and the Dairy.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a fragment of a letter to Lord Lyttelton, Mrs.
Montagu describes her visit to Dr. Young. She had
heard “the Dialogues of the Dead praised to the highest
degree, and with taste and judgment in a most delicate
sense of their moral merits.”</p>

<p>Through Mrs. Montagu, Dr. Monsey sends to Dr.
Young a powder for his rheumatism. From “Hog
Magog” on September 26, Dr. Monsey writes a long
letter to Lord Lyttelton, describing his visit to Tunbridge
to see “dear Amadissa,” meaning Mrs. Montagu. In
it he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may be new to your Lordship tho’ not strange,
that the Earl of Bath is fall’n desperately in love with
one who seems not insensible of his passion, and I
think ’tis time for you and I to look about us, for an
Earl is better than a Baron or a quack Doctor ... it
is impossible for me to tell your Lordship with what
warmth he talk’d to me about her, and so now there are
3 fools of us. ‘She is the most extraordinary woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
in the world’ with a nod of the head and a grave face,
‘she beats a french Duchess with an hard name all to
pieces, upon my word, Doctor, she is——’ ‘Ay, so she
is, my Lord, but neither I nor you know what.’ ‘Suppose
we say angel.’ ‘No,’ says I, ‘Devil, for she leads us all
into temptation.’”</p>
</div>

<p>On receipt of this, Lord Lyttelton wrote to Mrs.
Montagu, and says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wish Lady Hervey<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> mayn’t poison you for stealing
Lord Bath from her, as for myself, I will not plead
against him as my Rival that I am a younger man (for
that plea you will not regard) but that I am an older
friend. Adieu, inconstant woman, I feel horribly jealous,
but if you won’t love me better, pray love me next to
Lord Bath.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. BOWES’ FUNERAL — SIR JAMES COLEBROOKE</div>

<p>From Newcastle, on September 26, Mrs. Montagu

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I arrived here last night and had the pleasure
of finding Mr. Montagu very well. He went this morning
to Gibside to attend Mr. Bowes’<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> funeral obsequies,
which according to the custom of this county are to
be very pompous. Lord Ravensworth, Sir Walter
Blacket and all the gentlemen of Northumberland and
the county of Durham are to be at it, and I fear it will
be late at night before it is over, tho’ they are to set out
about 4 from Gibside to go to the church. My cousin
Rogers’ funeral we had order’d to be as private as
decency would permit, as he had been so long dead to
Society, but even that was attended by 38 gentlemen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
coaches, so I suppose a publick funeral must be three
or four hundred. In the South people live with more
pomp and dye with less. I hope not to outlive all my
vanity, for I have seldom seen a good and never an
agreeable character without it, but I think it should
not survive one, and I should desire not to go to the
grave with all this bustle, not that I should be afraid
any one should say of my funeral, as Pope does of Sir
John Cutler’s—</p>

</div>

<p>I love a blaze of wax lights and my friends about my
living person very well, but the torches and the crowd
about my dead body would give me neither light nor
amusement. Sir Walter Blacket call’d here this morning,
and said he hoped to ride in Hyde Park with you about
the 15th of November. I had a very pleasant journey,
for fine weather, like a good-humoured companion,
makes ordinary scenes appear chearfull and pleasant,
but from the time I left Hertfordshire till I got to
Doncaster, the counties I pass’d through were dreary
and barren, but if these prospects in the other counties
were brown, these in Northumberland are bleak, the
people in them a parcel of dirty Savages, so that I
cannot say with the Psalmist that my lot is fallen in
a fair ground, it is some comfort it is in a rich one, as
I shall see its produce at Sir James Colebrooke’s in
Threadneedle Street with great pleasure.... I met
Sir Thomas Clavering just before I got to Darlington;
he desired me to present his best respects to you and
beg your vote and interest, he sets up for the county
of Durham in the room of Mr. Bowes. Mr. Montagu
gives him all his interest. If the Bishop of Durham
should declare for Mr. Shaftoe (a very young man
whose Father formerly served for Durham), Sir Thomas
will be hard press’d. Lord Darlington will support
Mr. Shaftoe, and most people imagine the Bishop of
Durham will do so too. When applied to for Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Thomas Clavering, he answered he should act as he
found most agreeable to the majority of the county
gentlemen. Now I imagine Bishops as well as women
(both wear petticoats and a character of gentleness)
command while seeming to submit, ‘and win their way
by yielding to the tyde,’ and that my Lord Bishop in a
mild way of suggestion will bring the gentlemen to
that side he likes best, while he persuades them he
follows their inclination. I must say his Lordship is
much beloved from his liberality and affability, which
are fine moral qualities, as to Xian graces, no doubt but
he has them in a higher degree, so that as Prince Palatine
or Bishop he must influence many. The Dean of
Durham is strongly engaged to Sir Thomas, and there
will be a sort of schism in the church.”</p>

<p>“His house was the abode of Philosophical quiet
and disinterested friendship. The scene about it was
elegant, mild and beautifull Nature. The Hills on each
side and the vale underneath it were covered with
orchards, with Hop yards, with corn or fine grazing
grounds thro’ which wound a river.... Now the
Master is dead it is fall’n to the dullest of all dull
Divines, one Stillingfleet, cousin to him you know,
who has not taste enough to live there himself, but
leaves it to a curate. He desires his compliments to
Dr. Gregory, who was staying with the Montagus, and
adds, ‘I am glad the Scotch like my Dialogues.’ He
also desires if the Bishop of Ossory (Richard Pococke)
is with them to send him on to Hagley, and assures
Mrs. Montagu he is very well and grown quite plump.
His thinness was a constant joke with his friends, who
called him nothing but bones, and he contends if weighed
in the balance with Lord Bath, he would be found ‘very
wanting.’ The Devil take him for having so much witt
with so much flesh. He commends his new house
and his daughter, now living with him.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You tell me, good Madonna, that you are grown
<i>as robust as a milkmaid</i>. If you are so, I have no objection
to your going to Balls, Plays or Poppet Shows
if you please every night; but you have sometimes the
spirits of a milkmaid without the strength. However,
I believe Diversions are better for you than too much
reading, and therefore I am not sorry you have no time
to committ excess with your books. If I were to live
with you, I would not trust you in a Library or alone
in your Room but at stated hours with proper Intervals
of exercise and conversation.... I am glad to hear we
shall have another volume of <cite>Highland Poems</cite>. To
stay your stomach (for, as I know, your appetite is
eager towards them), I send you a copy of four of a
later date than the others now printed, and not much
inferior to them in the Natural Beauty and Force of
Description, tho’ not, I think, so bold and sublime.
Being purely descriptive, they could have nothing
dramatic or passionate in them as most of the others
have. But at the end of these you will find some
objections I have as a Chronologist and Historian to
the authenticity of the printed ones which it will be
hard to get over. Yet I am not persuaded myself they
are not genuine, for who can write so now? Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Rust<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> was so struck with them, he read them every
morning and evening aloud to the Family as a Chaplain
does Prayers. And the more I consider them, the more I
admire them. I have seen some specimens in a Latin
translation of the Poetry of the two most admired
Welsh Bards, but they don’t in any degree approach
to the greatness and the Beauty of these. I am charmed
with your comparison between the Greek Plays and
Shakespear. He is indeed unequalled in the power
of painting Nature as she is and giving you sometimes
the utmost energy of a Character of a Passion in short
Stroke and Dash of his Pen. I also agree with you that
the moral Reflexions in Shakespear’s Plays are much
more affecting by coming warm from the Heart of the
interested persons, than putt into the mouth of a chorus,
as in the Greek Plays. I am glad you like my favourite
Philoctetes. The faults you find with the Ajax are perfectly
just, yet I feel the grief of that hero when he
returns to his Reason, and especially in the scene
between him and Termessa. Suppose Belisarius had
gone mad with the unjust Disgrace he had suffer’d, and
in his Distraction had done actions which dishonoured
and exposed him to the Ridicule of his enemies, what
a fine subject would it be for a play if he had killed
himself upon recovering the Use of Reason. Setting
aside the poetical Fiction, Ajax is Belisarius, and
Sophocles has painted the horrors of a great mind
so overwhelmed and confounded with shame in a
very masterly manner.... I am glad your three
Dialogues are well liked in Scotland, where the Author
is not known. Those who know you and believe they
are yours are hardly fair judges. Your form and manners
would seduce Apollo himself in his throne of criticism
on Parnassus itself....”</p>

<p>From Newcastle, on October 24, Mrs. Montagu writes
to Mrs. Carter, telling her she had been suffering from
toothache. She mentions a sonnet sent to her by Mrs.
Carter, “which would have given me a pleasing melancholy

from table where I received your letter. Teach me
to love you less or imitate you better. I admire the

<p>On October 25 King George <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> died suddenly. Dr.
Monsey wrote to inform Mrs. Montagu of this event,
from St. James’s, and that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The suddenness of his Death made people call it
an apoplexy, but I conclude otherwise from it. An
apoplexy, except when a vessel breaks in the brain, is
not so very rapid. People live four or six days or
more, that is, they breathe and have a pulse. The King
died in an instant, and from some strange odd faintnesses
and oppressions upon his breath, I was almost sure ’twas
in his heart or the great vessels near. And upon opening
him, the Aorta, the canal which receives the Blood
directly, was found burst (a very uncommon case), the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Duke of Leeds says. I have known and seen it
thickened, cartilaginous (crusty), and ossified, but I
never met with a broken one; however, ’tis a species of
Death he wished for, sudden, and nothing could be more
so than this, for the instant that vessel breaks, the heart
stops for ever and for ever....</p>

<p>“The King<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> had a levee to-day at one o’clock at
Leicester House, and the Duke of Leeds, who with Mr.
Godolphin dined with us to-day, says he so designs every

finish your affairs without being in a hurry. The Court
goes into mourning on Sunday next ’tis said, and about
a month hence the King is to be buried.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE DEATH OF GEORGE <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> — MR. MACPHERSON</div>

<p>To this Mrs. Montagu replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Newcastle, ye 31st October, 1760.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“It would be perfect sacrilege and robbing the
mighty dead of his due rites, if one began one’s letter
with any subject but the loss of our sovereign; on which
I condole with your Lordship, in whom the virtue of
Patriotism, and the antequated one of Loyalty still remain.
I know you had that veneration for our late King which
the justice and prudence of his government so well
deserved. With him our laws and liberties were safe;
he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his
people and the respect of foreign governments; and a
certain steadiness of character made him of great consequence
in these unsettled times. During his long reign
we never were subject to the insolence and rapaciousness
of favourites, a grievance of all others most intolerable
when persons born only one’s equals shall by the basest
means perhaps possess themselves of all the strength of
sovereign power, and keep their fellow subjects in a dependance
on illegal authority, which insults while it subjects,
and is more grievous to the spirits than even to the
fortunes of free-born men. If we consider only the evils
we have avoided during his late Majesty’s reign, we shall
find abundant matter of gratitude towards him and respect
for his memory. His character would not afford subject
for Epic poetry, but will look well in the sober page of
history. Conscious, perhaps, of this, he was too little
regardful of sciences and the fine arts; he considered
common sense as his best panegyrist. The monarch
whose qualities are brilliant enough to entitle him to
glory, cultivates the love of the Muses, and their handmaid
arts, painting, sculpture, etc., sensible that they will
blazon and adorn his fame. I hope our young Monarch
will copy his predecessor’s solid virtues, and if he endeavours
to make them more brilliant by the help of
poetry, eloquence, etc., etc., the happiness and glory of
Britain will be great. His present Majesty’s religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
disposition, and decent moral conduct, give us hope we
shall not be plunged into riot, and lost in debauchery
and libertinism, which, if it were to take place at Court,
would soon affect a rich and luxurious nation, and the
profaneness and immorality of Charles the Second’s days
would, from the more prosperous state of our nation at
present, be outdone....</p>

<p>“I will now thank your Lordship for your letter and
the Highland compositions. Your remarks go far in
staggering my faith as to their authenticity. I think
they convince me the poems cannot be as ancient as
pretended. It seems to me possible, that some great
bard might from uncertain and broken tradition, and
from the scattered songs of former bards, form an epic
poem, which might not agree with history. The pillars
in the hall of Fingal struck me at first reading; but I
imagined they might not refer to polished marble pillars,
but to smooth lime or beech trees which one may suppose
to have been used as supporters in very rude
buildings, and which would look smooth and shapely to
one not used to polished marble; and I imagine convenience
taught the use of such supporters long before
they were introduced as ornaments.... I hear Lord
Marchmont says our old Highland bard is a modern
gentleman of his acquaintance; if it is so, we have a
living Poet who may dispute the <i>pas</i> on Parnassus with
Pindar and the greatest of the ancients, and I honour
him for carrying the Muses into the country and letting
them step majestic over hills, mountains and rivers
instead of tamely walking in the Park or Piccadilly....
The Bishop of Ossory tells me Mr. Macpherson receives
an £100 per annum subscription while he stays in the
Highlands to translate the poems; if he is writing them,
he should have a thousand at least....</p>

<p>“Dr. Gregory, in talking of Mr. Hume, said he had a
great respect for your Lordship. The Dialogue of Bayle
and Locke could not be agreeable to him.... Dr.
Gregory says Mr. Hume told him he spent an evening
with me at Mr. Ramsay’s, and he had received very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
favourable impressions of me, and, I find, said much
more of me than I deserve. The Doctor told him I was
not of his freethinking system, but Mr. Hume thinks
that no fault in a woman.... Dr. Monsey is revenging
my coquetry with Lord Bath by an assiduous courtship
of Miss Talbot, but he can no more be untrue to me
than the needle to the pole!”</p>

<p class="greet2">“According to my promise, I now write to tell
you the news of the town; and it is with great pleasure
that I can assure you all parties unite in the strongest
expressions of zeal and affection for our young King,
and approbation of his behaviour. Since his accession
he has shown the most obliging kindness to all the
royal family, and done everything that was necessary to
give his government quiet and unanimity in this difficult
crisis.... There will be no changes in the ministry,
and I believe few at Court. The Duke of Newcastle
hesitated some time whether he should undertake his
arduous office in a new reign, but has yielded at last to
the earnest Desires of the King himself, of the Duke of
Cumberland, and of the heads of all Parties and Factions,
even those who were formerly most hostile to
him. His friend and mine, Lord Hardwicke, has been
most graciously talked to by the King in two or three
audiences, and will, I doubt not, continue in the Cabinet
Council with the weight and influence he ought to have
there.... Lord George Sackville has been admitted to
kiss the king’s hand, and thus ends my <em>gazette extraordinary</em>.
As for myself, I got well to town on Wednesday
night, was at Court on Thursday morning, was
spoken graciously to by the King, and am told by everybody
that I grow fat.” He then urges Mrs. Montagu to
return from Northumberland at once. “I have often
told you that you are a mere hot-house plant, fine and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>

<p>“The King has opened his grandfather’s Will in
presence of all the royal family, and it is said the Duke

was supposed. The next best share is the Princess
Emilia’s.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The sums are not mentioned. Mr. Pitt has

upon the first stone of the new bridge. I would have
sent it you with to-day’s paper in which it is printed,
but somebody has stolen it out of my room. You will
see it in the next Chronicle. It speaks of a certain <em>contagion</em>

catch valour and prudence from him, to the great benefit
of our affairs.”</p>

sell something and to get money. I found that a Scotch
countess had bought all the black cloth, crapes and
bombazeen, black ribbons, and fans at Darlington before
the poor shopkeepers knew of the King’s death. She
bought a great many suits of broad cloth and crape,
which must be with an intention to sell them at a higher
price in town, but surely nothing could be more mean
than to enter into such a traffick and take advantage
of the Shopkeepers’ ignorance, and it seems to me not
honest. This lady is wife to Lord C——t; I believe I mistook
when I called her a countess. The town was soon
inform’d of the reason she had bought such a quantity
of mourning, and I wonder she was not mobbed. The
ladies at Darlington and in the neighbourhood are very
angry, for she left but two yards of crape in the whole
town.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING’S FIRST SPEECH — GOING TO COURT</div>

<p>Writing on November 20 to her husband, Mrs.
Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The young King spoke his speech<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> with great grace;
his voice, they say, is very fine, and his delivery most
remarkably good. The Princess Dowager is not to be
at St. James’s, and people think she looks chagrin’d; no
doubt she had visions of power and authority which will
probably not be answered; all people seem glad that she
is not likely to have influence. Dr. Wilson made a very
flattering sermon at Court, upon which the King express’d
great displeasure, and order’d all the Chaplains should
be told he did not come to Church to hear himself praised.
Lord Egremont<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> made a fine speech in the House of
Lords for the address. Lord Royston is to move for
the address in the House of Commons to-day, and Sir
Richard Grosvenor,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> who is to be made a peer, it is
said, seconds him. Mr. Pratt<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> is to be made Lord Chief
Justice in room of Willes, whose son is to be Solicitor-General,
and Mr. York attorney. Some say Pratt is to
be made a Peer. There seems a very strong union
between Pitt and the Duke of Newcastle, but as yet
no one knows how things will combine. The whole
Cocoa Tree<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and every human creature has been at
Court, and this being said one day in a large company,
I was ask’d when I should go. I said not till you came
to town, but when you did you intended I should be
presented. Mrs. Boscawen said she suppos’d I should
be introduced by Lady Bute, as we were relations,
and visited; I answered no, for I should not go as a
courtier....</p>

<p>“I should ask Lady Cardigan to carry me, who was
the head of the Montagu family, and a person who went
as a great independant lady to pay her duty to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
sovereign without being a courtier. It seems if I am
to go to Court, I must not appear anywhere till I have
kiss’d hands, which makes it necessary, if done, to be
done soon, but I shall wait your orders, and I beg you
to speak freely.”</p>

<p>“The distance j am now at from you, unhappily
hinders me from discussing an affair of this moment
with you and consulting with myne or your friends.
At present j can only say that if you mean nothing
more than paying your duty to our new sovereign j
see no harm in it, and j think Lady Cardigan of all
others the properest person to introduce you; but if
you go further, before you give your attendance at a
Court, j wish you would take the consequences into
your most serious thoughts. The principal reason of
my absenting myself ever since j was Member of Parliament
was that j did not concur in the measures that
were then taking, and the Principal members in the
opposition thought they had no business at St. James,
and j believe neither the wifes of the Peers nor of the
Members of the House of Commons were found there.
If j should be still so unhappy as out of dislike for
the present measures not to alter my way of acting,
and not to appear at Court, would it be proper for you
to be attendant? Indeed, it seems to me that it would
not, but if you can make out the contrary upon any
sound Principles of reason j will readily submit. I
have for many years liv’d in a state of Independancy
though j may truly call it of Proscription, so far as
those could make it to those who thought not, and acted
not with them where politics they thought endanger’d
the Liberties and good of their country, am j to alter
now, or maintain the same conduct j hitherto have
done? Whilst j flatter’d myself that we were in the
same way of thinking, and that my conduct met with
your approbation, j did hardly suffer anything. I then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
thought and still reflect with the utmost sense of gratitude
on the sacrifice you made me in your early bloom,
by giving up all the pleasures and gaieties of a Court,
and it was the greater because you had all the advantages
of beauty and sense to shine and make a figure
there. I think that capacity is not so far gone as you
in your modesty are pleas’d to say, and j may add in
some sense perhaps improv’d, either at a Court or anywhere
else j wish you every thing that is good that you
may long enjoy that good will and esteem which your
merit has acquir’d you, and leave the rest to your own
candid and impartial consideration.”</p>

<p>To this his wife replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had yesterday your most kind and judicious
letter, and my own way of thinking coincides so much
with yours I have no merit in acquiescence. Your
wonted independancy I hope in God you will ever
preserve.... If you should be in opposition, I shall
drop going at all; as to Peers, all who were not profess’d
Jacobites, and also their wives, always went to
St. James’, even the most protesting Lords, till the

<div class="sidenote">MR. PITT AND THE SECRET</div>

<p>On November 22, from Hill Street, Mrs. Montagu
writes to her husband that her toothache having been
very agonizing, she had sent to Mr. Lodomie to examine
her teeth. As he is often mentioned, he must have
been the fashionable dentist of that period. In the same
letter we read that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“there has been a quarrel between General Townshend<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>and Lord Albemarle,<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> which had ended in a
duel if Mr. Stanley<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> had not carried the Captain of the
Guards to take them into custody. The story is too
long for a letter. Mr. Townshend appears to have been
too hasty: Lord Albemarle behaved very well, and all
is now made up. Mr. Beckford in the House of Commons
the day before yesterday call’d our German campaign
this year a <em>languid campaign</em>, for which Mr. Pitt
gave him a notable threshing, repeating languid and
languor several times, and once how rash must that
gentleman be, how inconsiderate, if he calls this languid,
after repeating what had been done, and after enlarging
on everything, again, again, and again, retorting the
<em>languid</em> upon Beckford, who himself made a languid
campaign, not returning to the charge. I heard of a
good piece of witt of Mr. Pitt on my Lord Mayor of
London’s absurdly asking him in the Drawing-room,
where the secret expedition was destined. He ask’d
his Lordship if he could keep a secret, which the grave
Magistrate assured him he could upon his honour, and
expected to be inform’d, on which Mr. Pitt only made a
low bow and said, <em>so can I, Sir</em>, a very proper reproof
for his impertinent question.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sire</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“Amidst the Congratulations that surround
the Throne, permit me to lay before your Majesty the
Sentiments of a Heart, which tho’ oppressed with Age
and Infirmity, is no Stranger to the Joys of my Country.
When the melancholy news of the Late King’s Demise
reached us, it Naturally Led us to Consider the Loss we
had sustained, and upon what our Hopes of futurity
Depended: the first Part excited grief and put all the
tender Passions into motion, but the Second Brought
Life and Spirit with it, and wiped away the tear from
every face.</p>

<p>“O how graciously Did the Providence of God provide
a Successor able to bear the weight of government
in that unexpected Event.</p>

<p>“You, Sir, are the Person whom the people ardently
Desire, which Affection of theirs is happily returned by
your Majesty’s Declared Concern for their prosperity;
and Let Nothing Disturb this Mutual Consent. Let
there never be but one Contest between them, whether
the King Loves the people best, or the people him, and
may it be a Long, very Long, Contest between them,
may it never be decided, but Let it remain doubtful, and
may the paternal affection on one side, and the filial
Obedience on the other, be had in perpetual Remembrance.
As this will probably be the Last time I shall
ever trouble your Majesty, I beg leave to express my
warmest wishes and prayers on your behalf: may the
God of heaven and earth have you always under his
protection, and Direct you to Seek his honour and
Glory in all you Do, and may you reap the Benefit by
an increase of Happiness in this world and in the

with such vivacity and spirit, at past four score; and
oppress’d as he says with age and infirmitys. But
strange as that may be, I know a more extraordinary
thing, and that is of a Person near the same age (but
without infirmitys indeed) that is at this Instant over
head and ears in Love. How does he wish he could
write with as much Spirit and Love to his Mistress,
as the Bishop does with Loyalty to his Master, with
this difference only, the one wishes this contention of
Love may never be decided, the other hopes it may
be brought to an issue as soon as possible, by the only

it to my friends, under such restraints as would secure
me from blame in case of accident. As I do not expect
a billet-doux every morning, I was unluckily asleep
(observe that I do not say not dreaming of Lord Bath)
when your letter arrived. I cannot express how much
I admire your Lordship’s parody of a Bishop’s pastoral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>

of four score, your Lordship will not expect I should
immediately comply with your proposal; but if you
will be content with a sentimental love till I arrive at
the tender age of eighty, a person and a passion so
ripened by time must be very yielding. And according
to the latest reckoning of the learned and ingenious
Mr. Whiston, the Millenium will then commence, so
that we may have a proper period in which to prove
our constancy and love; and at a moderate computation,
may produce a thousand of those proofs of it
which your Lordship seems to think the best testimony.</p>

something of that kind, in the pleasure I propose to
myself of making Mr. Montagu jealous, and of triumphing

promise me either of these forty years hence? In
conscience therefore reduce the horrid period of forty
years to twenty at most, and tell me in your next, come
twenty years hence and be happy. But all you promise
in your letter is, that the beginning of next century,

</div>

<div class="year">1761</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew Robinson</span>, Mrs. Montagu’s eldest brother,
who had been member for the borough of Canterbury,
did not propose to offer himself for re-election to the
new parliament, but presented the Canterbury address
to the new king at Court. He was clad in such a
peculiar and uncourtierlike garb that his sister writes
to her husband at Newcastle—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am glad he is gone into the country, but he has
made a most astonishing appearance at court with the
Canterbury address. Morris says he hears of nothing
else. I wish the Beefeaters had not let him pass the
door. Lord Harry Beauclerc on the buzz his appearance
occasioned, desired the people to be quiet, for
that he had never seen the gentleman so well dressed
before.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">ADMIRAL BOSCAWEN ILL</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu, having attended the Durham election
in favour of Sir Thomas Clavering, was preparing to go
to Huntingdon for his own re-election. In Mrs. Montagu’s
next letter she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I told you in my last that Admiral Boscawen was
ill of a fever, I hope he is out of danger. The noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
admiral does not fight so well with a fever as he does
with the French; he will not lye in bed, where he would
soonest subdue it. Poor Mrs. Boscawen is very anxious
and unhappy about the Admiral, and indeed the loss to
her and her children would be as great as possible.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this letter she remarks upon having heard from
Mrs. William Robinson, her sister-in-law, from Lisbon
dated November 12: “they are all well, and going on to
Madrid.” “They” were the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Robinson,
his wife, and her brother, Mr. Richardson, who, being
in bad health, was ordered abroad, and was going to
Italy. On December 20, Admiral Boscawen is reported
as out of danger, but on the 27th Mrs. Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His fever still hangs upon him, his strength is
quite subdued; any sudden attack, any degree more of
fever, and my dear Friend loses a good husband, her
children a fond father, their situation in life will suffer
a grievous alteration, and the publick will be deprived
of a man who serves it with zeal and ability and is
always more tender of the honour of his country than
of his own person.”</p>
</div>

<p>The admiral had a relapse, and Mrs. Montagu, with
her husband’s permission, flew to see her friend, but,
to avoid alarming the admiral, slept at Mr. Botham’s at
Albury. She, however, returned to London, as the
admiral could not bear his wife out of his sight, and
begrudged any friend taking her away from him for an
instant. In this same letter she mentions that old Mr.
Wortley Montagu was very ill.</p>

<p>Dr. Monsey, who himself was very unwell, wrote on
January 9 to tell Mrs. Montagu he was sure the admiral
would not recover; he begs her to remember it is God’s
will, and “to try and guard Mrs. Boscawen’s mind and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
let money and the world be thrown into the Coal
Hole.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF ADMIRAL BOSCAWEN</div>

<p>The admiral expired on January 10 at 7 a.m. He
died of a putrid fever, and before death sent for his
sister, Mrs. Frederick, to desire her to take his wife and
children to London the moment he was dead. Mrs.
Montagu went at once to her friend to endeavour to
comfort her. Mr. Montagu, with his characteristic
kindness, begged Mrs. Boscawen to go to Hill Street,
but she remained at the Admiralty. Mrs. Montagu
writes of her on January 17—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I thank God her mind is very calm and settled, she
endeavours all she can to bring herself to submit to this
dire misfortune; I know time must be her best comforter,
so that I oppose her lamentations rarely and
gently, but when they continue long, set before her the
merit of her five children, the want they will have of
her, and the comfort she may derive from them....
Mr. Boscawen has left all his fortune, except a purchase
he made in Cornwall, to Mrs. Boscawen at her entire
disposition, the land in Cornwall he has left her only
for life, and then to his eldest son. This estate cost but
£10,000, and so is a small part of his fortune, so that the
children are entirely dependent on her. I hear old Mr.
Wortley can last but a very short time. It is supposed
Lady Mary will come to England.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF OLD MR. WORTLEY MONTAGU</div>

<p>Writing to her husband, still at Newcastle, at the
end of January, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe it will be agreeable to you to hear that
Lord Sandwich called on me this morning to desire me
to write you word that he hopes that the second week
in February you will be ready for Huntingdon; his
Lordship says he will give you only two days’ trouble,
one to canvass, another to be elected.... Mr. Wortley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Montagu dyed last night, the disposition of his effects
not known as yet, by next post you shall hear.”</p>
</div>

<p>In her next letter she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have had a full account of Mr. Wortley’s will, it
runs thus:—‘To his son £1000 per annum rentcharge,’
with an order it should not be liable to his debts, which
by-the-bye is nonsense. The Leicestershire estate, we
know to our sorrow is his. If the present wife<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> dyes
and he has legitimate issue, that issue is to have the
Wortley estate. In case he has not such issue, then
the whole of his personal and real estate is to go to
Lady Bute’s second son, he taking the noble name of
Wortley. Two thousand pounds apiece indeed to each
of Lady Bute’s younger children! The old gentleman’s
wealth is reckoned immense.”</p>

</div>

<p>In another letter his estate is stated to be £800,000
in money, and £17,000 per annum in land, mines, etc.!</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu writes in reply to this—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am extremely sorry that Mr. Wortley has made
such a will as you mention. I think he has been
unworthy of being a Father. I cannot pretend to say
but his son gave him too good reason to take care he
should not waste and consume his estate, it was mine
and the opinion of others that, as the phrase is, he would
have tyed him up, but if he had done it in the literal
sense he would have been less cruel to him; this poor
man was not without very good parts, he was greatly
altered; if he had done kindly by him, it was not impossible
that he might have been reclaimed and have
yet made some figure in life. What is now to become
of him I don’t know. I suppose he is not to come into
Parliament again, and if so I cannot see what he can do
but leave his native country, and live in perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
banishment abroad. I cannot but greatly commiserate
this poor man, and reflect with horror on his cruel
unrelenting parent.”</p>
</div>

<p>On February 15 Mr. Montagu writes from Hinchingbrooke,
as he spells it—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“We got here on Friday night. Our canvassing
the town is put off to Tuesday. Lord Hinching<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> is

and by the addition of two or three rooms is very convenient,
and he says without much expense.... Calling

<p>To this Mrs. Montagu replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I return the Tragedy with many thanks. The
character your Lordship gave of it kept up my hopes
and my spirits through the long tedious speeches with
which it opens, and upon the whole it appears to me to
be one of the best of Voltaire’s Tragedies, as it is, what
few of his are, interesting. Pompous declamation
season’d with Moral reflections is surely far from the
perfection of dramatick writing, tho’ in a nation too
much polish’d and refin’d, it is prefer’d to the natural
sallies of passion in our Shakespear, as fops love
essences better than the flowers from whence they are
extracted. I find in this Tragedy many petty larcenies
from Corneille. The character of Aménaide is in
part an imitation of the Sister of Horatius, but the
Roman name supports the <i>fierté</i> of her character, born
in any other city I should call her a termagant, there I
consider her as a She Roman, the female of the Lion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
The fair Amenaide is too much an <i>esprit fort</i> in regard
to her duties to please me. She does not follow Virtue
as by law establish’d, but despises forms and follows
sentiment, a dangerous guide. Design’d by Nature to
act but a second part, it is a woman’s duty to obey
rules, she is not to make or redress them. I must
confess that Aménaide is noble and heroick, and a
proper mistress for a Knight Errant, whose motto is
‘l’amour et l’honneur.’ I have seen many poems
form’d on the manners of Chivalry, but I never saw
them before in Drama. They admit of the bombast in
honour and love, which the French and Spanish Theater
affect, and will furnish those brilliant sentiments they
so much admire, but which indeed come better from
any Muse but the pathetick Melpomène.</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad of the honour of your Lordship’s
company on Saturday evening. I was to have
gone to the play that night, but if my fever should have
left me by that time, I have a cough which would be
louder than Mrs. Prichard.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> I have taken the liberty to
enclose Mr. Macpherson’s proposals, and if your Lordship
designs to subscribe to the work, and have not
already done so, I should be very glad to have the
honour of your name on my list. I have read the first
canto,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> which far exceeded my expectation. The various
incidents recited take off that sameness of character
which appeared in the detached pieces, and which were
their greatest fault. The original Ersh is to be seen
at Mr. Millar’s. I have also enclosed a letter from
Edinburgh which gives an account of these poems. By
this long letter I have taken some revenge upon your
Lordship for not coming here last night, and now I am
in perfect charity, mix’d with some compassion for the
trouble I have given you.</p>

Now, Madam, as I neither wear a mantua nor pettycoats,

<p>This is the dialogue which I believe has not yet been

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Berenice and Cleopatra.</span>”</p>

<p><i>Berenice.</i> The similitudes and dissimilitudes of our
fortune have long made me wish to converse with you,
if the charming, the victorious Cleopatra by her lover
prefer’d to glory, to empire, to life, will deign to hold
converse with the forsaken, the abandon’d, the discarded
Berenice.</p>

<p><i>Cleopatra.</i> The scorns of Octavius, the bite of the
aspic, the waters of Lethe have so subdued my female
vanity, that I will own to you I greatly suspect my
greater success with my lover did not arise so much
from my charms as in my skill of management of them.</p>

<p><i>Berenice.</i> I can scarce understand you. Beauty and
love I thought to be the greatest attractions. In the
first you must have excell’d me, but in the second you
certainly could not: I had beauty, youth, regal dignity,
and an elevated mind. I was distinguished by many
qualities and accomplishments which were so dedicated
to my Lover, that of all I had been and all I could be,
I was, I would be, only <i>l’amante</i> of Titus. I thought the
next person in merit and dignity to Titus himself was
the woman who ador’d him, and I was more proud of
the homage I paid him, than of all I had receiv’d from
lovers or subjects. But you, Cleopatra, had loved Cesar
before Anthony, and other passions besides the gentle
one of love seemed still to have your heart. Yet for you
Anthony despised the dangers of war, the competition
of a rival in Empire, the motives of military glory, and
the resentment of a Senate and people not yet taught to
submit to or flatter the passions of a master. Over
these you triumph’d; but I was sacrificed to the low
murmurs of the people, and the cautious counsels of
gray-headed Statesmen. Was it that Minerva desired
to triumph over Venus in the noblest and gentlest heart
that ever was contain’d in the breast of mortal? Tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>me, Cleopatra, for 1700 years have not made me forget
my love and my grief?</p>

<p><i>Cleopatra.</i> I have often with attention listen’d to your
story; and your looks, on which still remain the sadness
of a lover’s farewell, move my compassion. I wish I
could have assisted you with my counsels when Titus
was meditating your departure. I would have taught
you those arts by which I enslaved the Soul of Anthony,
and brought Ambition and the Roman Eagles to lye at
my feet.</p>

<p><i>Berenice.</i> Your arts would have been of little service to
me, I had no occasion to counterfeit love. From Titus’s
perfection one learn’d to love in reality beyond whatever
fiction pretended; no feigned complaisance could imitate
my sympathy; if he sigh’d I wept, if he was grave I
grew melancholy, if he sicken’d I dyed. My heart
echoed his praises, it beat for his glory, it rejoiced in
his fortunes, it trembled at his dangers.</p>

<p><i>Cleopatra.</i> Indeed, Berenice, you talk more like a
Shepherdess than a great Queen. You might perhaps
in the simplicity of pastoral life have engaged some
humble Swain, but there was too much of nature and
too little of art in your conduct, to captivate a man used
to flattery, to pleasures, to variety. I find you was but
the mirror of Titus, you gave him back his own image,
while I presented every hour a new Cleopatra to Anthony.
I was gay, voluptuous, haughty, gracious, fond
and indifferent by turns; if he frown’d on me, I smiled
on Dollabella; if he grew thoughtful, I turn’d the Banquet
to a Riot. I dash’d the soberness of counsels by
the vivacity of mirth, and gilded over his disgrace by
show and magnificence; if his reason began to return,
I subdued it by fondness, or disturb’d it by jealousy.
Thus did I preserve my conquest, establish my fame,
and put Anthony first in the list of</p>

<p>
“all the mighty names by love undone.”<br>
</p>

<p>Had I only wept when honour and Octavia call’d him
home I might have been the burthen of a love ballad, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
subject of a tender Elegy, who now am the glory of our
sex, and the great instance of beauty’s power. Do not
you wish you had used the same managements?</p>

<p><i>Berenice.</i> I might have used them had I loved the
same man: Cleopatra, the coquette was a proper mistress
for the Reveller Anthony; but the god-like Titus,
the delight as well as Master of Mankind, left no part of
the heart unengaged and at liberty to dissemble. What
had not yielded to his wisdom, submitted to his witt,
was subdued by his magnanimity, or won by his gentleness;
when affection does not vary, behaviour cannot
change; and methinks Anthony should have quitted you
from distrust of your love, and Titus have retain’d me
from confidence in mine. After what you have told me,
I am more than ever surprised at your fate and my
own.</p>

<p><i>Cleopatra.</i> If you want this explain’d ask Eneas,
Theseus, Jason, and the infinite multitude of faithless
lovers, but if my authority will pass, believe me Anthony
was preserved by his doubt of my love, and Titus
was lost by his confidence in yours. Do not look so
concern’d. From the era of your disaster to this very
day you will find every faithful and fond Berenice discarded,
while the gay, vain, and capricious fair one is to
her Anthony a Cleopatra and the “world well lost.”</p>

<p>Emin, from “Standgate Creek, on board of the ship
<i>Northumberland</i>,” writes on May 5 to Mrs. Montagu,
addressing her thus—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the wisdom of Europe, sister to the great King
of Prussia, excellent Mrs. Montagu.”</p>
</div>

<p>Not only did he think Mrs. Montagu equal in cleverness
to Frederick the Great, but he considered her forehead
and eyes like his, to the great indignation of Lord
Bath and Dr. Monsey, who pronounced it impossible
she should resemble so bloodthirsty a character.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter took leave of Mrs. Montagu on May 18,
and that very evening Mrs. Montagu writes to her—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You left London only this morning, and I am
writing to you to-night; does it not seem unreasonable?
I hope not, as you must know there are habits which
it is hard to break, and alas! I was in the habit of conversing
with you every day. I feel like a traveller, who
by the chearfull light of the Sun has pleasantly pursued
his day’s journey, but seeing it below the horizon, enjoys
and would fain prolong the twilight, which tho’ it has
not the warmth and lustre of the noon-day, yet is a
kind interposition between it and the gloom of the
night.”</p>
</div>

<p>She dates her letter from Ealing, where she had
gone to the Botham’s for the night, “imagining I should
hear your tones better from the nightingale than in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
din and chatter of London.” So much did Mrs. Carter
value Mrs. Montagu’s letters that she always noted the
day and year of their reception of them, which is a
great help to an editor in compiling, as many of Mrs.
Montagu’s letters are undated. In the end of this letter
she mentions that she is returning to London next day
to spend the evening with Mrs. Boscawen, who was to
leave the Admiralty that day for her new house.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From Sandleford, on June 23, Mrs. Montagu writes
to Mrs. Carter—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I told you in my last that I was going to take
a flight into Berkshire; and here I have been ever since
Friday evening, leading a Pastoral life in the finest
weather I ever saw. Tho’ the most sage Horace says
we change our climate without changing our disposition,
I must be of another opinion, for by only the
difference of latitude and longitude between Hill Street
and Sandleford I am become one of the most reasonable,
quiet, good, kind of country gentlewoman that ever
was. In the days when misses employ’d their crimping
and wimpling irons upon cheese-cakes and tarts, not on
flounces and furbelows, and matrons used no rouge, but
a little cochineal to give a fine colour to a dried neat’s-foot
tongue, they could not be further from the temper
and qualities and conditions of a fine lady than your
humble servant at this present writing. My health is
much improved by the country air; I saunter all day,
and when Phœbus sets in the material world, he rises
in the Intellectual; then I sit down to read what he has
inspired, and I find the amusements of the day here prepare
me well for my evening’s lecture....</p>

<p>“The mention of poetry puts me in mind to tell you
I am very well satisfied with the share of praise you
give to Cowley.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> He had a rich vein of thought, but
being too ostentatious of it, we are disgusted at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
proud display of his treasures, as at the pomp of a rich
man, when it goes beyond the bounds modesty and a
sound judgment should set to it. I agree with you that
his love verses are insufferable. I think you and I who
have never been in love, could describe it better were
we ask’d, <i>what is it like?</i> I think some of his verses, like
Anacreon, very pretty, and the verses by the god of love
in honour of Anacreon are very pretty tho’ a little too
long. I think you was too temperate in your commendation
of ‘La Mort D’Abel.’<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> I was infinitely
delighted with it as a work of genius. On your recommendation
I lent it to my Lord Lyttelton, who
sent it back with great approbation. But to be sincere
in spite of you both, some silly prejudices against the
Author and the language the poem was originally
written in, a little damped my expectations, and the
beginning, in which he imitates Milton, with all the
faintness of reflected beams, make me advance very
soberly. But what a feast is the Patriarchal dinner!
How sweetly innocent their manners! Eve’s horror
at the first storm, her surprize at Adam’s fastening up
the mouth of the cave, concern at the first sight of death,
which is finely supposed to seize a dove, because in that
animal only could the grief of a surviving friend be
shown, with ten thousand other circumstances in hers
and Adam’s narration, all so natural and yet so new
that I must call Mr. Gesner a Poet. A Poet should
create, but he should not make monsters. I think our
Author has not the sublime, but his genius suits his
subject. What a noble piety! what a purity of heart
in Abel! and how finely is his character contrasted
with Cain’s. Abel’s are virtues of disposition and
temper in a great degree, and so are Cain’s vices, which
rightly imagined in a state of life where example and
discipline could not have so much influence as in a
larger society and more mix’d life. Milton’s and Mr.
Gesner’s pastoral scenes are so ennobled and refined by
Religion, that the Shepherds and Shepherdesses who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
worship the wanton Pan and drunken Silenus, make a
mean figure when compared to them. I agree with you
in liking Mr. Gesner’s Pastorals extreamly, but let him
still keep to the more than golden age of the Poets. I
would fain propose to him to take the story of Joseph
next. He has a fine genius for Drama! The last three
books of Abel make a noble tragedy. Did you not drop
a tear at the lamentation of Cain’s children over Abel’s
body? <i lang="fr">Il ne se reveillera plus! Il ne se reveillera plus!</i>
How simple! how natural! how affecting! What a
witchcraft is there in words! repeat, <i>il est mort</i>, it is
nothing, but the simplicity of children who had not a
name for death and the words at once signifying the
circumstance is very touching.... I have taken a
house at Tunbridge from the 3rd of July. I hope my
dear friend will be ready to come to me. I shall send
the post-chaize to you as soon as I am at Tunbridge.</p>

<p>Writing from Sandleford on June 26 to Mrs. Scott,
Mrs. Montagu mentions that she is going to Tunbridge</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“for 6 or 7 weeks perhaps, and the rest of the summer
I shall pass at Sandleford, except my excursion to Bath
Easton. Mrs. Carter is to come to Tunbridge to me as
soon as I get thither, and, I hope, stay with me the
whole season. I was so fortunate as to enjoy her company
much longer in town this year than usual, but that
only makes me wish the more to have her again. She
was not in the house with me in town, preferring the
quiet of a lodging to herself, and indeed it would not be
any delight to Mr. Montagu to have her in the house;
tho’ he says she would be a good sort of woman <em>if she
was not so pious</em>.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> My Lord Bath told me he was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
go to Bath on Wednesday, the day we dined with
him....</p>

<p>“I shall have Mrs. Boscawen for my neighbour at
Tunbridge; she is to be at Sir Sydney Smythe’s, only
three miles from the Wells. Lady Frances Williams
is in the deepest affliction for Lady Coningsbye.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> To
show the last respect to her, Lady Frances staid in the
house with the dead body in spite of all her friends
could do; she did not leave Lady Coningsbye’s house
till last Saturday; she has been so singularly unfortunate
that, had she not the strongest piety and the
strongest reason to support her, she must sink under
the repeated strokes of affliction.... I suppose you
have read Dr. Hawkesworth’s<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> ‘Oriental Tales,’ it is
not written with so much spirit as the Oriental tales
in ‘the Adventurer’ which were by him, but there are
some fine things in it.... I have heard my Lord Bath
speak with great regard for you and Lady Bab Montagu.
I believe we shall call on him on Monday, on our
way to London. We were asked to dine or lye there in
our journey down, and at our return. He has recovered
his health and spirits and is the most delightfull companion
imaginable. I think he has great good qualities,
and I do not perceive the least of that covetousness
which was attributed to him while his wife lived; he
lives nobly, entertains generously, and I know many
acts of generosity he has done, and I have known them
from the report and acknowledgements of the persons
obliged, for by his behaviour to such of them as I have
seen at his house you would think he had received
favours from them, which nobly enhances the benefit.
He seems to have the strongest sense of Religion, and
on all occasions to show it without the ostentation of
one who wants to be praised for piety, nor does he ever
in the gayest of his conversation forget the respect due
to every moral duty. It would give one pain to discover
any faults in one who has such extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
perfections and endowments, and I think his Lordship
has outlived the errors which the hustling of a mighty
Spirit may in youth have led him: as to his consort,
she was, in Milton’s phrase, <em>a cleaving mischief in his
way to virtue</em>.</p>

Carter is a great favourite, and I hope we shall have a

to his wife that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“there was a great appearance of the privy council
when the King declar’d his intention of demanding the
Princess of Mecklenburgh in marriage, a request that
can never be denied. The family is ancient, and the
blood high, but I suppose the Dukedom not very rich,
but this may be helped with subsidies, etc., but this is
not much to be grudged if by making our young Monarch
happy it contributes to that of the Nation, tho’
Princes are under a disadvantage from which their subjects
are free, of marrying those whom they have never
seen or convers’d with, still I hope there is reason to be
believed that this alliance, as it was of the young Monarch’s
choosing and not of the imposing of a Father,
and as money, etc., is out of the case, that care has been
taken by those employ’d to give a true information both
of the perfections of the mind and body of this Princess,
and he will be happy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu adds that the pictures at Newbold
Verdon were to be sold for Mr. Edward Wortley-Montagu’s debts,
but that a list of them had been sent
to him by Mr. E. Wortley-Montagu, who desired to
know which he would accept of as a present. Mr.
Montagu had marked his brother’s portrait (Mr. James
Montagu), and asks his wife to say if there were
any she wished for. Very probably the picture by
Sir Peter Lely of the first Earl of Sandwich, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>

<p>On July 20 Dr. Stillingfleet writes from Stanlake,
Berks, the seat of his friend, Richard Neville Aldworth,
expressing his regret that he cannot accept
Mrs. Montagu’s kind invitation to Tunbridge Wells,
as his friend, Mr. Aldworth, had made him promise
to spend a summer with him at Stanlake. “This
friend has had his constitution broken so by the
gout, that he is become a valetudinarian, and therefore
I can the less think of leaving him. He is
ordered by his Physician to drink the Sunning Hill
Waters, and we are going there as soon as he is
able.” Mr. Aldworth was an ancestor of Lord Braybrooke’s.</p>

<p>On July 30 Dr. Young writes that he is obliged
to refuse Mrs. Montagu’s kind invitation “as he
had a friend with him he could not leave,” and as
“her Royal Highness sent me word she would send
for me when she wanted me; for these reasons I
deny myself the great pleasure of waiting on you.
I have ordered some Stanzas to be sent to you;
they are of a cooling nature, and may qualify your

<p>On the 8th of July George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> had announced his
intention of demanding in marriage the Princess Charlotte
of Mecklenburg Strelitz; negotiations were immediately
commenced. Mrs. Montagu writes from
Tunbridge Wells to her husband thus—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are all disappointed here at hearing our new
Queen is fair; the first report was that by a lively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
bloom she would cast a shade over the white complexions
of our royal family. The sight of our brilliant
Court, the salutations of our navy on her arrival, the
opulent appearance of our towns, and the greatness of
our capital city will astonish her. I hope her mind is
more proportioned to her lot in marriage than such a
situation is to her present circumstances. A noble
mind will fill a great situation, and enjoy it with pleasure
and gratitude, without the swellings of insolence, but
such a change is dangerous where there is a mediocrity
of sense and virtue. I heartily wish she may be worthy
of our young King, be pleasing in the domestick scene,
and great in the publick; his good nature will impart to
her a share of power and a degree of confidence, and I
wish for the publick she may never abuse the one, nor
misapply the other. There seems not to be a very good
choice of ladies about her, there is not one who is quite
fit to teach her even the forms of her publick conduct,
none at all equal to advise her private, ignorant as she
must be of the behaviour that will be expected of her,
she should have had some woman of quality of remarkable
discretion, character, and politeness, whom high
birth and great situation had approached as nearly as a
subject can to the station of a Queen. Lady Bute would
have been the properest person, but I suppose she
might out of delicacy avoid putting herself about the
Queen’s person, as thinking it might look like watching
her, and indeed so happy as Lady Bute is in her circumstances,
the slavery of personal attendance is more than
anything but great ambition could pay her for. I
think, however, they have chosen the ladies<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> of the bedchamber;
her Majesty must consult Lady Bute upon
everything.... Lord Bath always inquires after you

<div class="sidenote">A LETTER OF ADVICE — <span lang="fr">LES BELLES LETTRES</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE FEAR OF GOD</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu’s letter of advice to Mr. Thomas
Lyttelton, who had now left Eton and gone to Christ
Church, Oxford, though undated, may be placed here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Tunbridge, 28 (July?).</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I have often check’d my inclination to write to
you while you were at Eton for fear of calling you off
from your school exercises; but as you are now in a
situation, where there is a vacancy of business and
pleasure, I do not feel the same scruples, may write
you long letters, and expect full answers to them. However,
I will be so far reasonable, that if you send me a
card, to signify that you are engaged for the week, or
month, to Cicero or Livy, it will be a more valid excuse
to me than if, on inviting you to dinner, you told me you
were engaged to a beauty or a Duchess. My love for
you, my hope of you, my wishes for you, and my expectations
from you, unite in giving me a respect for your
time, and a deep concern for your employment of it.
The morning of life, like the morning of the day, should
be dedicated to business. On the proper use of that
‘sweet hour of prime’ will depend the glory of your
noon of life, and serenity of the evening. Give it, therefore,
dear Mr. Lyttelton, to the strenuous exertion and
labour of the mind, before the indolence of the meridian
hour, or the unabated fervour of the exhausted day
renders you unfit for severe application. I hope you
will not (like many young men who have been reckoned
good scholars at Eton and Westminster) take leave of
it there, and fall into the study of <i>les belles lettres</i>, as we
call our modern books. I suppose from the same courtesy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
the weakest part of the rational species is styled the fair
sex, though it can boast of few perfect beauties, and
perhaps the utmost grace and dignity of the human form
is never found in it. As you have got a key to the sacred
shades of Parnassus, do not lose your time in sauntering
in the homely orchards or diminutive pleasure gardens
of the latter times. If the ancient inhabitants of Parnassus
were to look down from their immortal bowers
on our labyrinths, whose greatest boast is a fanciful
intricacy, our narrow paths where genius cannot take
his bounding steps, and all the pert ornaments in our
parterres of wit, they would call them the modern’s folly;
a name the wise farmer often gives to some spot from
whence the Squire has banished the golden harvest, to
trim it up for pleasure with paltry ornaments and quaint
conceits. I should be sorry to see you quit Thucydides
for Voltaire, Livy for Vertot, Xenophon for the bragging
Memoirs of French Marshals, and the universal Tully
and deep Tacitus for speculative politicians, modern
orators, and the dreamers in Universities or convents.
I will own that in Natural Philosophy and some of the
lesser branches of learning the Moderns excel; but it
would not be right for a person of your situation to
strike into any private paths of Science. The study of
History will best fit you for active life. From history
you will acquire a knowledge of mankind, and a true
judgment in politics; in moral, as well as physical enquiries,
we should have recourse to experiments. As to
the particular study of eloquence, I need hardly exhort
you to do it; for eloquence is not only the most beautiful
of all the daughters of wisdom, but has also the
best dowry; and we may say of her, as Solomon did of
her Mother, riches and honours are in her right hand.
Elevation of sentiment and dignity of language are
necessary to make an orator; modern life and modern
language will hardly inspire you with either. I look
upon Virtue as the muse of Eloquence, she inspired the
phillippics of the Grecian and Roman Orator, her voice
awakened Rome, slumbering in the snares of Catiline.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
Public spirit will teach the art of public speaking better
than the rules of rhetoric, but above all things, the
character of the orator gives persuasion, grace, and
dignity to the Oration. Integrity of Manners gives the
best testimony of sincerity of speech. If you form your
conduct upon the sacred book which gives rules far more
perfect than human wisdom could contrive, you will be
an honour to religion, a support to your country, and a
blessing to your family. It may seem strange that I
have last mentioned what should be first regarded. The
Bible alone will make a good man; human learning without
the fear of God, which is the beginning of Wisdom
and the knowledge of Him, which is understanding, will
produce but a poor inconsistent character; but duties
are enlarged and multiplied by the power and circumstances
with which God has intrusted us, and in which
He has placed us. Your talents and situation will fit
you for public trusts; it is a duty in you to qualify yourself
for them, to give your virtue every strength, and
then to employ it in the service of your country in its
most important interests, true religion, and good government.
I hope you will excuse my having said so much,
that has the air of advice to one who wants it so little,
but young people are apt to be prodigal of time because
they think they have so many years before them; but if
life be long, the season for improvement is short.</p>

<p>“I hope Mrs. Fortescue<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> liked the Indian paper; it
is new and uncommon, and I thought much prettier

respects to her and my dear Miss Lyttelton.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> I hear
there will be a turnpike road between Oxford and
Newbury, and I hope you will frequently make use of
it. I shall leave Tunbridge on Monday. I have enjoyed
perfect health here, and the society of some of my best
friends, so you may believe I have passed the season
very happily, but a happy life seems always a short
one. Mrs. Carter was so good as to give me her
company in my house. My Lord Lyttelton and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Lord Bath were often with us; having had their characters
continually before me, you will not wonder I
should think great acquirements as well as great talents
necessary to make all possible perfection. I am sure
you will be pleased to hear that my Lord Bath greatly
approves and admires that part of my Lord Lyttelton’s
history which is already printed. I believe there is not
any one living whose approbation would give Lord
Lyttelton so much pleasure; talents and virtues and
extensive knowledge all in the highest degree join to
make him a perfect judge, and his great reputation
gives him a decisive authority; your Father is proud
of his praise as a critick, and pleased with it on motives
of friendship, which touch his heart more nearly than
any where vanity has a part, tho’ he is an author and a
poet. His Lordship’s Muse met him in the shades of
Penshurst, and with love or flattery prompted two
charming pieces, one to Mrs. Carter, and one to my
Lord Bath. Mrs. Carter, Dr. Monsey and Mr. Montagu
desire their compliments to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu went to London for the coronation,
which took place September 22, leaving Mr. Montagu
at Sandleford. She writes to him—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have not got any cold or mischief from the
coronation, at half an hour after four I got into the
coach, went by Fulham to Lambeth, from whence I
crossed the water in a boat which landed me at the
cofferer’s office, where I was to see the Show. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
a perfect view of the procession to and from Westminster
to the Abbey, and I must say it rather exceeded
my expectation. The ladies made a glorious appearance;
whenever there was any beauty of countenance or shape
or air they were all heightened by the dress. Lady
Talbot was a fine figure. The Queen, being very little,
did not appear to advantage. The King had all the
impressions of decent satisfaction and good-natured
joy in his face; looked about him with great complacency,
and tried to make himself as visible as he
could to the mob, but the canopy carried over his
Majesty’s head and the persons who carried his train
made him not so conspicuous. His behaviour at the
Abbey pleased much. It was perfectly dark before
the Procession returned from the Abbey, so we lost
the second view. I got into a barge which I hired
for 7<i><abbr title="shillings and">s.</abbr></i> 6<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i>, and got to the coach which waited at Yorke
buildings. Mr. Botham and his daughters are just
gone. Lord Lyttelton was near fainting away just as
the procession set out from the Hall, and was obliged
to sit down and take drops till a chair could be got
to carry him home. Lady Albemarle fainted presently
after. Lord Grantham was ill, but able to go thro’ the
ceremony.</p>

<p>“The early hour the Peers and Peeresses are forced
to rise at and the weight of their robes and all the
whole affair is fatiguing, but they make a good figure,
for there is something very majestick in the dress.</p>

<p>“I believe my Lord Bath will come down to us
about Wednesday or perhaps Tuesday. I shall be at
Sandleford on Monday.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">HIS MAJESTY’S BEHAVIOUR</div>

<p>In another letter describing the coronation to Mrs.
Carter, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is impossible to say enough of the behaviour
of the King. During the procession his countenance
expressed a benevolent joy in the vast concourse of
people and their loud acclamations, but with not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
least air of pride or insolent exultation. In the religious
offices his Majesty behaved with the greatest reverence
and deepest attention; he pronounced with earnest
solemnity his engagements to his people, and when
he was to receive the Sacrament he pulled off his
crown. How happy that in the day of the greatest
worldly pomp and adorned with the ensigns of regal
power he should remember his duty to the King of
Kings. The Archbishop pleased much in the Coronation
Service. I am indeed grieved at the heart for
Mrs. Chapone:<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> all calamities are light in comparison
of the loss of what one loves, uniquement; after that
dear object is lost the glories of the golden day are
for ever overcast, and there is no tranquillity under the
silent moon, the soft and quiet pleasures are over,
business may employ and diversions amuse the mind,
but the <i>soul’s calm sunshine and the heartfelt joy</i> can
never be regained. Mrs. Chapone has great virtues,
and if she has the Martyr’s sufferings will have the
martyr’s reward.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD LYTTELTON’S LETTER</div>

<p>On October 5 Lord Lyttelton writes to Mrs. Montagu
from Hagley a long letter, an extract of which I
give—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tom proposes to give a ball to some young people
of the neighbourhood on this day sennight, which will
add to our number and our jollity. He desires me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
tell you that if you were within twenty miles of our
Ball-room he would invite you to it among the handsome
<i>young</i> women; which you may notify to the cynic
Monsey, when he talks to you next of the <i>horrid gulph of
forty</i>, and bid him hold his fool’s tongue. I believe you
fib about your age and make yourself at least ten years
older than you are, to be nearer to Lord Bath. I hope
you have been, and are still as happy with him at
Sandleford as your heart can desire. You will not
think it a compliment to either of you when I say, that
I would be glad to exchange all the mirth of our ball
for the dullest of your evenings; but I will add in great
truth, that I would give up the finest day in Hagley
Park for a rainy one in your company. I had a letter
last post from the Dean,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> in which he says, ‘Your Lordship
must not be surprised if you hear in a post or two
of Mr. Secretary Pitt’s and Lord Temple’s being out of
their employments. Unless something extraordinary
happens, this event will certainly take place in a few
days. I have this intelligence not from common report,
but from the best authority. The reason given for their
resignation is the opposition made in the Cabinet to Mr.
Pitt’s proposal of sending a fleet immediately to intercept
the Spanish Flota daily expected home, and likewise
to attack their men-of-war wherever they are to be
found, but your Lordship knows there are other causes
of discontent.’ If this should be true, I imagine Lord
Egremont<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> will be Secretary of State and Lord Hardwick<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
Privy Seal. Mr. James Grenville will probably
lay down with his brother, which will make a vacancy
at the Cofferer’s Office, one of the few I might take if
there was an inclination to bring me into employment.
I wish much to know Lord Bath’s opinion of Pitt’s
advice. To me it seems to be that of a man who (in a
political sense) <i>fears neither God nor man</i>. It certainly
must be founded upon a supposition that a war with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Spain is inevitable, which I should hope is not true;
and even in that case I think England ought to be very
cautious not to appear the aggressor, which this conduct
would make her. But I had rather hear his Lordship’s
judgment upon this question than give my own.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD BATH’S JOURNEY — THE POSITION OF MINISTERS</div>

<p>Lord Bath had left Sandleford before this letter
arrived there.</p>

<p>On October 8 he writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can never sufficiently, Madam, acknowledge my
great obligations to you and to Mr. Montagu for the
honours I received at Sandleford. Six more agreeable
days I never passed in my whole Life, but when one has
been excessively happy we always pay most severely
for the change, when forced to quit it. This made the
Doctor’s<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> journey and mine most excessively stupid and
melancholy. He was seized with such a soporifick
Torpor (as if a deluge of rain was hanging in the clouds),
and yet we had not a drop the whole way, and I was so
wretchedly miserable, that all I could say to him was,
‘Doctor, I passed over this same ground yesterday
from coming from Padworth much more cheerfully and
happily than I do now, but one comfort is that we are
allowed the liberty of hoping for a renewal of the same
happiness some other time.’ When we got to Reading,
where we stopped for 10 or 12 minutes (without getting
out of our chaize), our landlady seeing we looked
melancholy, endeavoured to comfort us by telling us
a piece of good news, that an express was just arrived
with an account of a complete victory obtained by the
King of Prussia over the Russians. On this we speculated
and ruminated for some time, when we met Mr.
Cambridge, who assured us it was all a lye, but that
another event had occurred which would surprize us
extremely, and then told us Mr. Pitt<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> had quitted the
seals; this astonished the Doctor more than it did me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
who had received some hint of it before, but we both
agreed it was a very unlucky time for adventuring on
such rough measures, so near the Meeting of Parliament,
and before anything was fixed for the obtaining of peace,
or preparing for a further prosecution of the War; in
short, we ended in wishing all Ministers at the Devil,
rather than that their disagreements and dissentions
amongst one another should bring any difficulties or
dishonour on the best man in the world, the master of
all of them.... I will make this reflection upon all
human happiness, that the state and duration of it is
extremely uncertain. A minister may be a very great
and think himself a very happy man one day, and
nothing at all the very next. Just so was I, Madam,
happy beyond measure a few days ago, and now forced
at a terrible distance to be assuring you that I am, with
all possible respect,</p>

</div>

<p>Lord Lyttelton writes on October 14 to Mrs.
Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since my last, Mr. Pitt has brought his bark into a
happy port. A Barony for his wife and a pension of
£3000 a year for three lives are agreeable circumstances
in a retreat, which delivers him from the difficulty of
carrying on the War, or making the Peace, and keeps
all his laurels green and unfading on his brow. No
Minister in this country has ever known so well the
times and seasons of going in and coming out with
advantage to himself. I hope there will be new gold
boxes sent to him by the cities and Boroughs to express
their sense of his noble and <i>disinterested</i> conduct, and to
assure him that their lives and fortunes are all at his
service. In effect, I hear that all over this country since
first we had the news of his resigning the Seals, the cry
of the people in Taverns and Alehouses is, ‘No Pitt, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
King.’ However, I imagine that as he has condescended
to accept of this mark of royal favour, he will be so good
as to allow the King to remain on the throne.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">AN ACT OF HUMILITY</div>

<p>On the same day as this last letter Dr. Monsey
writes from St. James’s to Mrs. Montagu. This paragraph
is interesting—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But here’s a Rout about giving a patriot 3<i><abbr title="shillings and">s.</abbr></i> 6<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> for
his past services either for speaking to the purpose, or
holding his tongue for a very good one. Why, he might
have been Governor-General of all North America with
a pension of £5000. This was confidently said at the
‘Mount’ Coffee House as offered by the King, and was
told by Manby as coming from P——, <i>no joke indeed</i>, no
more than he has advertised seven good horses, ‘<i>late
Mr. Pitt’s</i>,’ to be sold. There’s an act of humility for
you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Miss Mary Pitt, Mr. Pitt’s sister, writes to Mrs.
Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“Tho’ I suppose you know all that has
happened since last Monday, I cannot forbear talking
to you upon what the King has been so very gracious as
to do for my family, in granting a pension of three
thousand pounds a year to Mr. Pitt for three lives, and
as he knows that he feels a repugnancy to having his
name upon the Irish pensions, his is upon the American
Duties, and the Peerage which his Majesty has also
done him the honour to bestow upon his family is given
to Lady Hester,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> who is made Baroness of Chatham, by
which means he is left still at liberty to be an Alderman;
as to all the rest, which you may know, I will do <i>comme
si vous ne saviez pas</i>. My Lord Egremont received the
Seals of Secretary of State yesterday, my Lord Temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
gave up his seals yesterday, and I was informed last
night that my Lord Hardwick was to be Privy Seal,
which I do not doubt, tho’ it is not declared. Mr.
George Grenville is not to be Speaker, that he may
have the management of the House of Commons. My
Lord Temple is very angry with him, and I believe very
much disappointed; at the same time I am assured that
my Lord Bristol writes in the strongest manner everything
that can give satisfaction to the present Ministry
with regard to the intentions of the Spanish Court, and
those despatches are said to have come Wednesday last....
I heard a few days ago from Paris that the Duc de
Nivernois<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> had got a passport for my nephew.” This
was for Mr. Tom Pitt.</p>

<p>At this period Dr. Gregory lost his wife, and was in
great despair; she was a daughter of William, Lord
Forbes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WIDOWS’ WEEDS</div>

<p>At the end of October Mrs. Montagu set out on a short
visit to her sister, Mrs. Scott, and Lady Bab Montagu
at Bath Easton. Dr. Monsey was then at Bath, whither
later Mrs. Montagu also repaired. Bath society was enthusiastic
upon the subject of Mr. Pitt and a political
letter he wrote at this period. From a letter written from
Bath to Mrs. Carter about a Mrs. Talbot, a reduced
lady, who was an applicant for a lady’s-maid situation,
we learn that £10 per annum were regarded as adequate
wages for such an attendant. I subjoin a curious paragraph
as to a widow’s dress—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fashionable dress for a widow is a gown with
two broad plaits in the back, a short cuff which comes a
little below the elbow, round double ruffles very shallow.
The dress weed is made of silk made on purpose, undress
crape, a black silk long apron, black handkerchief,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>black hood, and a plain sort of night-cap. Either a night-gown
or sack may be worn with a short train, no flounce
or ornament of any sort, and if a sack scanty, and only
two broad plaits. Many women of condition who are
not young, wear merely a common crape sack, the
younger sort wear the dress that denotes their widowhood,
and in a country town I should suppose the full
form must be observed. I imagine your enquiry is for
poor Mrs. Primrose.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A CALL FOR POETRY</div>

<p>On November 17 Mrs. Montagu writes from Hill
Street to Mrs. Carter—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I had this day the pleasure of receiving my
dear Friend’s most charming ode. I, alas! am like
Monsr. Jourdain, I speak nothing but prose, but I
believe my heart feels with all the enthusiasm of poetry....
My Lord Bath is vastly happy that you are to be in
town the 1st of January. My Lord Lyttelton is better,
but his fever is not quite gone.... I think you should
print the verses my Lord Lyttelton addressed to you
from Penshurst. Pray write some more odes, and let
your seamstresses do your plain work, and the Clerk
transcribe your verses.”</p>
</div>

<p>This year an edition of Mrs. Carter’s various works
was printed. When Mrs. Carter was in London she
lodged with Mrs. Norman in Clarges Street. Mrs.
Montagu having ascertained that she could have her
lodgings there from the 1st of January, adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You do not deign to mention Fingal, etc., but that I
could pardon, for Poet Ossian has been dead full many a
day, but there is a head on which laurels now grow, and
it bears more than Parnassian bays, even wreaths of
sacred Virtue, and this head is apt to ake, and then my
heart akes for sympathy. Poor Lady Pomfret by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
weary stages reached Marlborough, from thence she
yesterday morning quitted the weary journey of human
life and passed with resignation to a better. I am angry
with Dr. James for sending her in so hopeless a state
from her quiet home to the noise and inconvenience of
Inns.... I think Mr. Rivington must be bewitched. I
will send the books as you direct. I had a quadrille
table last night; and last week the Bard Macpherson
and many others of the tuneful train and we had the
feast of shells and drank out of a nautilus to the
immortal memory of Ossian. The Nautilus, you know,
is a perfect sailor as the other is a poet by nature. I
am a little mortified that you had not a word to fling at
Ossian. Take a modern Poet Laureate and put out his
eyes and see whether he will sing as sweetly, tho’ he
sings darkling.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE <i>BAS-BLEUS</i> AND SHELLS</div>

<p>The <i>bas-bleus</i> from this time constantly celebrated,

<p>Lord Bath’s portrait, not satisfying Mrs. Montagu, had
been returned to Mr. Reynolds for amendment, and
Lord Bath writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="greet2">“I will sitt to Mr. Reynolds either Wenesday
or Saturday next, whichever is most convenient to him,
and shall be glad to meet Mr. Tristram Shandy (as you
call him) or Mr. Sterne (as I must call him) there, but
where it is to be you do not mention. If the alteration
can be made in a quarter of an hour, it is scarce worth
taking the Picture out of your house, but if it is to be
altered at Mr. Reynolds’ I will be there on either of the
days mentioned. Last night I slept extreamely well and
the better since I went from Mrs. Vesey’s, happy in
seeing you look so charmingly and well....</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span></p><div class="sidenote">LAURENCE STERNE</div>

<p>Lord Bath had remarkably penetrating and brilliant
eyes, and one of the faults found with the picture was
in the representation of this feature.</p>

<p>The next letter from Lord Bath runs—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How cruel was it, before I got out of bed, to receive
a letter forbidding me coming to you this night! but I
hope nothing will prevent me from having that happiness
to-morrow. On Wenesday about one of the Clock, I
will most certainly be at Mr. Reynolds’ to mend my
sickly looks, and to sitt down in my chair, as I should
do; instead of being half standing, which criticism of
Mr. Sterne’s I think perfectly right; as for my looks, I
fear they will not be much mended by any Physick of
Mr. Reynolds. He has made an old man look as if he
was in pain, which an old man generally is, and so far
he is right.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu took Mr. Sterne to the sittings so
that he might amuse Lord Bath with his <i>bons mots</i>!
Surely this would form a pretty and historical picture if
any artist would paint it.</p>

<p>On the publication of her poems, to which Mrs.
Carter looked forward in a nervous frame of mind,
Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am sorry for your tremors and trepidations, but
they are mere nervous disorders, and the manuscript
must be printed, so my dear Urania, away with your
lamentations, sit down, revise, correct, augment, print,
and publish. I am sure you will have a pleasure in
communicating the pious, virtuous sentiments that
breathe in all your verses. My inferior Soul will feel
a joy in your producing such proofs of genius to the
world.... The very best of your poetical productions
have never been published, they may indeed have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>seen by a few in manuscripts, but the finest things on

</div>

<p>Writing to her brother, William Robinson, then at
Rome, at this period, Mrs. Montagu congratulates him
on the prospect of a son or daughter—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I desire to have all the share I can in the little one,
shall be happy to be accepted as a godmother, and
thank you for being so obliging as to intend it my name
if it is a girl; it will not disgrace her if she should be a
toast, for I once knew a Miss Betty Robinson that set
up for one; if it is not disagreeable to you I should be
glad if it was christened Elizabeth Montagu, which will
be also a compliment to my husband. I envy you, my
dear brother, the pleasure of seeing at your leisure the

<h3 class="nobreak">“LONG” SIR THOMAS ROBINSON.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir Thomas</span> was the eldest of the seven sons of William Robinson,
of Rokeby, Yorkshire, by his wife, <i>née</i> Anne Walters. He was
born and baptized at Rokeby in 1700. After his school-days
he made the grand tour, as was the fashion of the day, and then
entered the Army. At the death of his father in 1719, he succeeded
to the family estates in Yorkshire. At the General Election of 1727
he became M.P. for Morpeth. On October 25, 1728, he was married
at Belfreys, in Yorkshire, to Elizabeth, widow of Nicholas, Lord
Lechmere, and daughter of Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle.
Between the years 1725 and 1730 he rebuilt the house at Rokeby,
removed the church which stood behind the house and rebuilt it
in another spot, he added a stone wall all round the park, made a
bridge over the Greta river, and erected an obelisk to his mother’s
memory in 1730. All these acts were recorded on two stone piers
at the Greta entrance of the park. He planted many trees at Rokeby.
He designed the west wing of Castle Howard for his brother-in-law,
Lord Carlisle. In 1731 he was made a Baronet of England, with
remainder to his brothers. His nickname of “Long” Sir Thomas
Robinson was given to him from his great height, and to distinguish
him from another Sir Thomas Robinson, a diplomat of note, afterwards
created Lord Grantham. These two men were the reverse of
each other in appearance, “Long” Sir Thomas being exceptionally
tall, and the other very short and fat. One of Lady Townshend’s
<i>bon mots</i> about the two was, “Why one should be preferred to the
other I can’t imagine, there is but little difference, the one is as
broad as the other is long;” and Lord Chesterfield, on being told
“Long” Sir Thomas was reported to be “dying by inches,” said,
then it would be some time before he was dead. On April 10,
1739, his wife, to whom he was tenderly attached, died at Bath, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
was taken to Rokeby and buried under the new church he had
erected. A monument was erected to her there. In accordance
with Sir Thomas’s will, though he himself was buried at Merton
Abbey, Surrey, a cenotaph was placed in Poets’ Corner, Westminster
Abbey, to his and his wife’s memory, with medallion portraits of her
and himself, and bearing the following inscription:—“To perpetuate
his grateful sense of the pleasure he had in the conversation of an
accomplished woman, a sincere friend, and an agreeable companion.”
They had no children, so the English baronetcy went to his next
brother, William.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas was greatly given to hospitality; too much so for his
income. On October 22, 1741, he gave a great ball, as Horace
Walpole relates, “to a little girl of the Duke of Richmond’s; there
are already 200 invited, from miss in a bib and apron to my Lord
Chancellor in bib and mace.” The ball began at 8 p.m., and ended
at 4 a.m. A few days after Horace Walpole writes, “There were a
197 persons at Sir Thomas’s, and yet it was so well conducted that
nobody felt a crowd. He had taken off all his doors, and so separated
the old and the young that neither were inconvenienced by the other.
The ball began at 8; each man danced one minuet with his partner,
and then began country dances. There were four-and-twenty couple,
divided into twelve and twelve; each set danced two dances, and
then retired into another room, while the other set took their two,
and so alternately.... We danced till 4, then had tea and coffee
and came home.” A month later he writes about a second ball.
What with his numerous entertainments and his building at Rokeby
and elsewhere, he became impoverished, and accepted the Governorship
of Barbadoes in January, 1742, from which he was recalled in
1747. In Barbadoes he married his second wife, a widow named
Salmon, <i>née</i> Booth. She had a considerable fortune, but on her
husband’s return to England, she refused to accompany him, preferring
Barbadoes. Sir Thomas was intimate with Lord Chesterfield,
who made an epigram on him, beginning—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">It shall be witty, and it shan’t be long.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He must have been a bore, for Sir John Hawkins says of him, “Sir
Thomas Robinson was a man of the world, or rather of the town, and
a great pest to persons of high rank or in office. He was very
troublesome to the Earl of Burlington, and when in his visits to him
he was told his lordship had gone out, would desire to be admitted
to look at a clock, or play with a monkey that was kept in the hall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
in hopes of being sent for to the Earl. This he had so frequently
done that all the household were tired of him. At length it was concerted
amongst the servants that he should receive a summary answer
to his usual questions; and accordingly, at his next coming the
porter, as soon as he had opened the gate, and without waiting for
what he had to say, dismissed him with these words, ‘Sir, his lordship
is gone out, the clock stands, and the monkey is dead!’” The
Duchess of Portland used to name him to Mrs. Montagu as “your
inimitable cousin!”</p>

<p>Appearing in Paris one day at a dinner in his hunting suit of
green and gold, and booted and spurred, a French abbé asked who
he was, and, on being told his name, and looking at his attire, inquired
if he was Robinson Crusoe. His house at Whitehall he sold to Lord
Lincoln, and he afterwards lived at Prospect Place, Chelsea. He
bought the gardens once belonging to Lord Ranelagh, and, with
other shareholders, erected the Rotunda in 1741–42. This place of
amusement lasted for quite forty years; the site of it is in the gardens
of Chelsea Hospital.</p>

<p>At the Coronation of George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> Sir Thomas, probably from
his great height and majestic presence, was chosen to represent the
mock Duke of Normandy and Acquitaine, the kings of England still
pretending to own those provinces.</p>

<p>In 1769 he sold the estate of Rokeby, Yorks, to John Saurey
Morritt, the father of Sir Walter Scott’s friend. The Rokeby estate
had been in the possession of the Robinsons 160 years. On March 3,
1777, Sir Thomas Robinson died at his house in Prospect Place,
Chelsea, at the age of seventy-six.</p>

<h3>SANDLEFORD PRIORY, BERKS.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sandleford Priory</span> was founded for Austin Canons by Geoffrey,
4th Count of Perche, and his wife, Matilda of Saxony, grand-daughter
of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> of England, and niece of King Richard Cœur de Lion,
and King John, before the year 1205. The town and manor of Newbury,
in Berkshire, were bestowed on the first Count of Perche, who
accompanied the Conqueror to England. The Priory was dedicated
to the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist. A dispute arising
between the Prior and Richard Beauchamp, Bishop of Salisbury and
Dean of Windsor about 1480, the religious forsook the house, and
King Edward <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> allowed the Priory to be annexed to the Chapel of
St. George’s, Windsor. In the Ayscough Register, folio 50, will be
found an account of irregular and scandalous behaviour of the Prior
of that period, which probably was the cause of the disruption. The
Priory now formed a parcel of the properties of the Dean and Canons
of Windsor, and it is stated by the commissioners of Henry VIII.
(<i>vide</i> c. 3, Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>) to be worth £10 annually.</p>

<p>In the reign of James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> Sandleford was declared to be a separate
parish from Newbury, and not subject to tithes which had hitherto
been paid to the Rector of Newbury. After this a commutation was
made that the lessee of the house paid £8 a year to the Rector of
Newbury, and for that sum had a pew in perpetuity. It is stated
that after this award the chapel of the Priory was allowed to fall into
decay. This chapel was separate from the house, and continued to
be so till 1781–2, when Mrs. Montagu employed Wyatt to build her
an octagonal drawing-room with ante-chambers, which united the
house and the chapel. Long previous to this it was used as a bedroom
or bedrooms, and in the Montagu manuscripts Hannah More
and others are described as sleeping in the chapel bedroom when the
rest of the house was occupied. At the beginning of the eighteenth
century the lessees of Sandleford were the Pitt Rivers of Strathfieldsaye,
and they were succeeded by the Montagu family as early as
1730, or perhaps earlier. At any rate, at that date Mr. Edward
Montagu was resident there, and as his mother, <i>née</i> Sarah Rogers,
lived with him (as is shown by a letter of 1733 which I possess), it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
possible Mr. Charles Montagu had been lessee before his son. He
died in 1721. At what period the chapel was dismantled I have no
record, but it may have been done by order of the Dean and Canons
of Windsor before their letting it as a residence. Elias Ashmole, the
great antiquarian, who died in 1692, describes the chapel as he saw
it, and says, “Upon the first ascent of steps towards the high altar
lyes a freestone tomb of a knight in mail, cross-legged, with a deep
shield on his left arm, and seeming to draw his sword, his feet resting
on a dragon. Written on the west wall is a Latin inscription.” In a
paper belonging to my uncle, the last Baron Rokeby, it is stated
the inscription was “written on the north wall of the chapel, but
more anciently on the west wall.”</p>

<p>This was the inscription:—</p>

    <div class="verse indentq">“Lancea, crux, clavi</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Die culpam, Corrige Vitam.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As to the monument, it has been stated to have been that of the
founder, Geoffrey, Count of Perche; but as he died in France at the
siege of Acre, it is more likely to have been his son Thomas, Earl of
Perche, who died at the battle of Lincoln in 1217; or else it is quite
possible that it might be one of the Earls Marshal of Pembroke, as at
the death of Thomas, Earl de Perche, his uncle William, Bishop of
Chalons, seems to have claimed the property and sold it to William,
2nd Earl Marshal. Anyhow, not a trace of this monument is now
to be found. And it would be very interesting to ascertain if it was
removed to the Temple church, where the other Earls Marshal of
Pembroke are buried and a very similar monument exists; but this
is only my surmise. Behind the chapel, when Mrs. Montagu made
her alterations in house and garden in 1780 to 1782 with the designs
of Wyatt and “Capability Browne,” a number of skulls and bones
were found, and, with the characteristic irreverence of the eighteenth
century, were buried in what is now called “Monkey Lane,” near
Newbury. The present library was originally the refectory. In 1836
Edward, 5th Baron Rokeby, parted with the lease of Sandleford to
Mr. William Chatteris, who eventually, in 1875, enfranchised the property
from the Dean and Canons of Windsor, and, dying a widower
and without issue, he left Sandleford to his second wife’s nephew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
Mr. Alpin Macgregor. Mrs. Chatteris was the second daughter of
Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, the friend of Nelson. Mrs. Myers, who
has a lease of Sandleford now, will not use the chapel as a dining-room.
Hannah More, writing in 1784, whilst staying at Sandleford,
says, “There is an irregular beauty and greatness in the new buildings,
and in the cathedral aisles which open to the great Gothic
window (alluding to the east end of the chapel, still all glass), which
is exceedingly agreeable to the imagination. It is solemn without
being sad, and Gothic without being gloomy.”</p>

<h3>DENTON HALL, NEAR NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE,
NORTHUMBERLAND.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Denton Hall dates from the ancient Britons, and a
burial-place of theirs, with an urn and bones, was found near the
Roman wall within a quarter of a mile from the hall. It subsequently
became the site of a Roman camp, which was occupied by a
garrison of Hadrian’s soldiers, and a wall was built to keep out the
Picts and Scots. Of the Roman relics there still exist an altar dedicated
to Jupiter, and several carved stones, and in Mrs. Montagu’s
time many Roman coins and objects were discovered. In No. 7,
Vol. 2, of the <i>Proceedings of Antiquaries of Newcastle-on-Tyne</i>,
1885, Mr. W. Aubone Hoyle, then living with his brother at the
hall, writes, “A little to the south-west stood a chapel, of which a
baptismal font remains and a few sculptured stones; adjoining these
was a burial-ground, which is now included in the garden. An
incised slab, with a memorial cross and sword, was found here some
years ago, as well as some large stone coffins; and a cist of ancient
British times, containing a funeral urn. The chapel was removed
shortly after the Reformation. The earliest record we have of the
occupants is of a family of the name of Denton, in the tenth century,
who continued to hold lands here and in the neighbourhood, and
also at Newcastle.”</p>

<p>The Widdringtons seem to have succeeded the Dentons, and
Mr. Hoyle continues, “The manor of Denton, saving these rents
paid to the Widdringtons, had been, in 1380, granted to the Prior
and Convent of Tynemouth, and was used by them as a country
residence or grange. Tradition relates that they had an underground
passage leading from Denton to their residence at Benwell Tower.
The present building was probably erected by them at the beginning
of the sixteenth century—1503 being the date of erection. The
Roman wall skirting its grounds appears to have supplied the
materials, as most of the stones are of the Roman type. The roof
was formed of flags fastened with pins made of sheep bones. These
have gradually been done away with until only a few courses remain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
and the flags have been replaced by tiles. At the Dissolution in
1539, the Widdringtons lost their interest in Denton, and the Erringtons
appear.”</p>

<p>The Erringtons being Jacobites, Mr. Hoyle continues, “Their
loyalty to the Stuarts cost them their estates, which now passed
to a family of Rogers, related to the Earl of Sandwich.” As has
been shown in this book, Mr. Edward Montagu, at the death of
his cousin, Mr. Rogers, became owner, to quote his wife’s words,
“of Denton; Mr. Montagu has half the estate by descent, a share by
testamentary disposition, and a part by purchase.” At the death of
Mrs. Montagu in 1800, the estate passed into the possession of her
nephew and adopted son, Matthew Montagu, afterwards 4th Baron
Rokeby, who let the hall to Mr. Richard Hoyle, and his descendants
occupied the house till 1889. Henry, 6th Baron Rokeby, dying in
1883, left the estate of Denton to his grandson, Lord Henry Paulet,
now 16th Marquis of Winchester, who in 1886 sold the whole
estate. The hall was bought by Mr. John Henderson, of Allendale,
who resold it to Mr. William Andrew I’Anson, the present
owner. The Denton ghost, called “Old Silky” by the miners, one
of the most authentic on record, is a beneficent spirit, for she is said
on various occasions to have warned the miners against coal-damp.
A song about her is still sung, I am told, in Newcastle, but hitherto I
have failed to obtain it, or to discover who “Silky” was. A further
account of her can be read in <cite>Ingram’s “Haunted Homes,”</cite> under
“Denton Hall.”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
